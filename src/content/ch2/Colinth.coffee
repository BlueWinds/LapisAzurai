    For the first time since taking possession of the Lapis Azurai, Natalie was reminded of exactly how <i>small</i> of a ship it was. While Colinth's docks teamed with fishing boats, cutters, and other ships of the Lapis' class, all of them moved around several hulking giants, clearly ships of war. Catapaults mounted on deck, tripple banks of oars, high fore and aft castles with arrow slits... Vailia had nothing like them.

    Not that Vailia <i>needed</i> anything like them. She could see James shaking his head, and thought he was agreeing with her estimate - a waste of good timber. They looked fearsome, surely and no other ship would dare stand before them, but their sails would be too small for long journeys on the open ocean, and the castles made it too heavy to survive a storm on the open sea.

    `K What are you two looking so morose about?` Kat nearly scared Natalie out of her skin, popping up behind her without warning.

    `N Warships. And they can't sail the open ocean, which means they're only good for bullying neighbors,` Natalie shook her head. `N I don't like it.`

    `K They're not all from Colinth,` Kat pointed. `K See, the sailors on that one are dressed differently.`

    Nat squinted and shielded her eyes from the sun with one hand, but couldn't make out anything more than 'there are people there' on the ship Kat pointed to, still distant. `N I suppose so. It would match with what I heard - Kantis and Colnith in an uneasy peace, taking turns dominating the region as the balance of power sways. Janos thinks it's unstable, will result in a war soon.`

    Kat muttered darkly, but shook her head when Natalie asked. `K Don't worry about it. So, what are we here for?`

    Natalie winced and rubbed her forehead. Something in the air around here felt miserable, a constant low buzzing. It had begun when she'd entered the shop, and Kat had only shaken her head, not feeling anything, when Nat had asked her. `N I'm sorry, what I got distracted. What was that?` She tried to refocus on the conversation.

    The merchant repeated his offer, a rather good price on fresh mulberries, but Natalie found her attention drifting again even as he went through the terms again for her. He had a most interesting amulet - a red gem of some kind on a silver chain. With a start, Natalie realized it was the source of the buzz that was distracting her so. It was magic. She wrenched her attention back to the business deal. `N Um, yes. I can take a small load first, see how well they sell in Vailia. The ones I've seen before haven't traveled well, but it's possible a faster ship like the Lapis might make the difference. You'll have to cover 50% of the cost though - I can't afford all the risk, even for a small sample run. Acceptable?`

    -- While he mulled it over, Natalie realized why the amulet hurt - it was tugging on her own power, and she'd reflexively raised it to protect herself. Using her own magic always brought pain. No wonked Kat hadn't felt anything.

    `K You like it?` Kat leaned close and whispered in her ear, apparently noting the way she was staring at the amulet.

    `N No! It hurts. It's magic.` She wanted to flick Kat's cheek, wipe off the speculative look that crossed her face, but instead had to turn attention back to the merchant. With the amulet. Which hurt to think about. `N I can't go lower than 50%, but I can certainly cut you in for half of the profit if it does go well. I'm looking to hedge the risk here, and that shouldn't be an issue if you're confident they'll keep properly on the voyage.` She fell back into haggling while Kat continued to stare at the amulet in a way that Nat tried to convince herself <i>didn't</i> mean she was going to steal it later.

    `N You didn't.`

    `K I totally did. Here.` Kat swung the amulet by its chain, staring at the stolen jewelry. She liked the red stone.

    `N You should give it back. I don't like it.` Natalie was rubbing her head the same way as she had been in the shop before.

    Kat grinned at her, giving her best 'I'm not sorry and you can't make me be' look, the one that Natalie found both exhasperating and endearing. She opened her mouth to chide her crew member more, but Kat shut her up by tossing the amulet to her. `K I want to know what it is, before you make me give it back to him.`

    -- Reflexively, Natalie caught it. White-hot light blazed from the captain's hand, and she whimpered. The light grew brigther, and Natalie screamed.

    Kat grabbed the pendant out of her hand, and the light vanished. Natalie slumped in her chair, breathing heavily. `K Are... are you ok?`

    `N Take it back to him,` Natalie managed. She whimpered and pulled her knees up to her chest as Kat leaned forward, accidentally bringing the amulet close to her again.

    Kat hesitated a moment, torn between the impulses, then firmed her resolve and ran to do as she was told.

  || bg=travel/DeckNight
    -- Her own breath was catching now, hoping against hope that Natalie was ok, wondering if it was ok to just leave her alone, cursing her own self-absorption... she nearly ran into Asara, who was running in the opposite direction, towards Natalie's cabin. Her first impulse was to shove the amulet into Asara's hands, tell her to deal with it, but even half panicked, she remembered that it might hurt Asara too, if it didn't like magic, and...

    A grip like iron descended on her shoulder, bringing her thoughts to a screeching halt. `A Who does it belong to?`

    `K I, it... it's the third house on the left, the big avenue eastward from the fish market, and...`

    The amulet didn't react when Asara took it from Kat's hand. Asara just shook her head, examining it. `A I will return it. You should not interfere with things you do not understand.`

    Kat raised her head, a sudden surge of annoyance that Asara would continue to remain mysterious when Natalie's life was one on the line, but there was no one to shout at. She was alone on the deck again, Asara already gone.

  || bg=travel/CabinNight
    -- `N I'm fine,` Natalie greeted her as she returned to the room. A little quiver remained to give lie to her words, but still, it was a big improvement from curled up in a ball. `N It stopped hurting as soon as you took it out of the room.`

    `K What was it?` Kat hugged her arms across her chest, uncertain voice barely above a whisper.

    `N I don't know. It just... it tried to taste my magic or something, and I resisted, which hurt. My power read that as an attack, and hit back, which hurt more, and, well, ouch.` She rubbed her forehead, then seeing the non-comprehension on Kat's face, `N I'm not sure why, but it's always hurt to use my powers. Usually it's under my control, so I'm expecting it and can brace myself, but...` She shrugged helplessly. `N Honestly, I'm not even sure the amulet was hostile. I think my lack of skill just caused a vicious cycle which spiraled out of control.`

    `K That's...` Kat hesitated, then threw her arms around Natalie, burying her head in the other woman's neck. `K I was so scared.`
