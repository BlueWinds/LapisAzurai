    Asara looked unhappy at the mention of her name. `A You are her commander, are you not?`

    `Guildmaster Something more like her father.` He saw the subtle widening of her eyes at that, quickly suppressed. He smiled. Though he'd been the one startled when she'd seemed to appear from thin air, now that he'd had a minute to observe her, he could see that she was practically vibrating with tension. `Guildmaster Please do not be so nervous. Any friend of Natalie's is a friend of mine, and your name is safe with me, I won't repeat it further.`

    `A Thank you.` She waited silently, giving nothing more.

    `Guildmaster I'd have thought you were from Kantis, except for the hair and the eyes. Sorry, I shouldn't pry.` He gave up on the idea of a proper conversation and instead just handed her a leather bound notebook. `Guildmaster This is what I wanted to give Natalie. Directions to Tomenoi. It's a halfway point between Vailia and Kantis, neutral ground. Natalie can buy a map of Kantis from there herself - with so many competing interests, they can't keep their maps secret enough to even charge a fair price. Please give her my regards.`

    Asara stood silently in the lobby of the Guild hall. No one approached her. No one met her eyes. It was unnerving, having so many people passing by and not one of them cared about her presence. The lack of attention - positive or negative - was unnerving. She was here on Natalie's business. She'd spoken with the ruler of this place, the one they called Guildmaster. Someone should have known why she was here and taken care of it without prompting.

    It was... sloppy. Disorganized. It was <i>loud.</i>

  || A/NormalFull
    She gave up hoping someone would approach her and finally went over to the desk set up to greet visitors. She waited for the clerk to recognize her. They'd never met, but he must have been given a description of her, surely...

    He grew nervous under her silence. With an internal shrug, Asara gave up hope of getting through this without having to speak to anyone. It wasn't a big deal, she tried to convince herself. Vailia was different from home, and she'd have to accept that if she wanted to make her way in Natalie's world. She could do this.

    `A Natalie Rowena's package.`

    ` Um! You're not allowed to just take anyone's mail, you know. But maybe... let's see...` He shuffled through several pieces of paper and began reading one of them, muttering to himself as he did so. ` Natalie, Kat, James... 'a blonde woman who doesn't speak much.'` He chuckled nervously. ` I suppose that would be you. But why is your name not on here? You weren't on the list of people approved to take packages for her last week when I checked, and the lists change so infrequently I didn't think to look...` He realized he was babbling and shut up. He held out the package for her.

    Asara let out a tense breath and took the package. She hated being babbled at. A curt nod to the clerk and she turned to leave. She didn't hate the city. Really, she didn't. It was just... she wanted to be back on the ship. Fewer people. People who knew her. She couldn't relax around strangers. She ignored the clerk's attempt to make more conversation and fled with all possible haste short of actually running.

    `N Guildmaster Janos,` Natalie grinned and sauntered into his office unannounced. It had cost her an obol at the front desk to see him on the quiet, but the look of surprise on his face as she sat herself down across from him was worth it.

    `Guildmaster Ah, welcome. I didn't know your ship was back already. Doing well, I hope?`

    `N Things are going well. Even found a few trustworthy officers. I also wanted to thank you for the route to Nonkenia - that was unexpected, and quite generous. Not sure what I did to earn that one. But that isn't why I'm here. I'm here because you need me to deliver something irreplaceable to Alkenia.`

    He quirked an eyebrow. ` I'm curious how you know that. I've only told one person, whom I'm sure you've never met.`

    `N Easy. <i>You</i> wanted to see me when I got back, which means you want something moved. You wanted to see <i>me</i> when I got back, which means you can't afford to have it lost at sea.

    `Guildmaster Very good, but wrong on two counts. Nonkenia is the destination, which answers why I gave you the rutter to get there. Also, it's a 'them' I want delivered, not an 'it.' You are certainly correct that I would much prefer to trust them to your care compared to someone else's, though.`

    `Guildmaster This feud between Alkenia and Nonkenia is doing no one any good. A war right in our backyard is bad business. While the prince, and thus Vailia, certainly has made a policy of non-interference in foreign politics, as a private individual I have somewhat greater freedom of action.` He smiled at the irony in those last words. The prince did what the Guild asked him to. "Private individual" indeed.

    `Guildmaster Please don't make that face. All I'm going to do is attempting to start peace talks, nothing objectionable. I wish you to carry a pair of diplomats to Nonkenia to arrange things, with all possible haste. You will, of course, be paid.`

    He didn't need to ask if she'd do it. Any number of reasons would have been sufficient alone - money, loyalty the man who was not far from a father, a desire to do good for the people of both cities, earning favor from the Guild. She just nodded.

Scarred and blackened, he traced a finger along a groove where the boards were coming apart. His mother had wanted to replace it for years, but James agreed with his father - it was a piece of family history, as irreplaceable in its own way as the anvil inside, upon which three generations of Thadels had made their living. He wondered how much of the soot on his fingers came from his grandfather. The door probably remembered him better than James did.

    The roar of the forge and billows of soot from the chimney above spoke of what he'd find if he went inside - his father shirtless and sweating, his mother shoveling charcoal into the furnace. That had been her job before James had been old enough, and doubtless was again since he'd run off to join Natalie's crew.

    He could smell it too, and not only in his imagination. Hot metal tickled his nose, smoke, sweat, warm winters and blazing summers, nestled alone in the attic above the shop. The heat and smells were benefits - better clean industry than effluent odors from the street, and they never worried about staying warm, unlike many neighbors. There were worse lots in life, and he had only to look around to be reminded of that.

But stop fidgeting anyway, because you're here now and I'm not leaving until I've made my rounds.` Grasping him firmly by the upper arm - without appearing to do so, because actually needing to drag her date around by the arm was too embarrassing to contemplate - Natalie made her way to the next noble she wished to speak with.

    He was enthusiastically discussing some point of politics or other with Antinua Vanyavanadar, completely undeterred she casually demolished his argument with an acidic comment. She was famous for, among other things, being indespensible at high society gatherings. Antinua served the vital function of keeping everyone else entertained while she punctured windbags and inflated egos. She was also partnered to the heir of one of Vailia's more influential trading partners, though that shy princess seldom appeared herself.

    Before she could get there though, Janos swept in and took her other arm, tugging her away. `Guildmaster Oh, Natalie, just the person I was looking forward to seeing tonight.` Natalie flashed James an apologetic look for leaving him alone, and let the Guildmaster pull her away.

    `N Having a pleasant evening, sir?`

    `Guildmaster Oh yes, just excellent.` He leaned in closely and lowered his voice. `Guildmaster I worked rather hard to get you this invitation, and while James is a fine young man, his nervousness is not improving your presentation.`

    Natalie sighed and glanced around. It was certainly true that, while she fit in perfectly well - cocktail dress, exotic hors d'oeuvres, fancy drinks, nobles and wealthy merchants and the highest ranks of the Guild - James was entirely out of place. `N I had hoped... well, I forget sometimes that he's the son of a blacksmith. But actually, why <i>did</i> you get me an invitation?`

    Janos quirked an eyebrow at her, as if the answer should be obvious. `Guildmaster Lady Meghan reaches the age of majority today.` He stopped, as though it should be obvious to her why that was important.

  || N/Upset
    It was, but Natalie said nothing.

    `Guildmaster Every fine young man in the city is here aiming for her affection.`

    Natalie pursed her lips.

    `Guildmaster Don't look at me like that, I'm not trying to marry you off against your will. I just thought...`

    Natalie frowned at him.

    `Guildmaster ...`

    `N I appreciate all you've done for me, sir, but I'll be having no more truck with this particular plan of yours than she will.` Natalie gestured towards the center of the garden, where a regular flock of smartly dressed young men clustered around a thoroughly miserable Lady Meghan.

    With one last poisonous look at Janus Natalie pulled her arm out of his hand and spun smartly, dress whirling around her. She went to go find James.

    `N Come on, back to the ship with you.`

    `J I thought I had to stay and...`

  || N/Angry
    She shushed him with a finger to his lips. `N I'm about to make a scene, and I don't want you caught up in any backlash.`

    `J That's... have I mentioned recently how much I admire you, Nat? Anything I can help with?`

    `N I'm Janos' protege - I can get away with this. You though, they'd hang you out to dry. You can watch, but go back to the ship afterwards and don't stop to talk to anyone. Especially not the Guildmaster.` She took the drink he'd acquired from his hand and drained it in one gulp.

    James nodded, eyes shining, and took the glass back from her, stepping back into the crowd and leaving her alone.

    Natalie took a deep breath, then stepped towards the crowd surrounding Meghan.

    She cleared her throat. Meghan looked at her, and slowly the suitors turned in her direction.

    `N Lady Meghan Vailia.` She caught Meghan's eye - Natalie couldn't wink, with all eyes on her, but she tried to make her tone sparkle, and hoped the lady would play along.

    `Meghan Yes, Natalie Rowena?`

  || Meghan/Angry
    Natalie wanted to sag to her knees in relief, but held herself still instead. Meghan's twinkling eye reassured her that she'd read the situation right. If Meghan hadn't decided to play along, this would have resulted in Natalie making a fool of herself. With the other young woman's help, though, she could make a fool of everyone else here instead.

    `N I have proposition to discuss.` Stunned silence rippled across the party.

    `Meghan I would be delighted to hear it.` She held out her hand in courtly fashion, and taking swift strides across the path that had opened for her, Natalie took it with a bow.

    `N Shall we retire to your apartment, my lady?` She kissed Meghan's fingers.

    `Meghan Please.`

    Natalie hadn't thought the silence could grow more complete, but it had. She no intention of actually proposing marriage, but almost ruined the whole thing by bursting out laughing at the stunned expressions on almost every face. Even the Guildmaster had the decency to look nonplussed.

    Escorting the maiden in whose honor the party had been thrown, Natalie made her exit to the sound of a pin dropping.

    `N I can't believe I got away with that,` Natalie burst into nervous giggles as soon as the door to Meghan's tiny little house closed behind them.

    `Meghan It was magnificent. I wish I could do that,` Meghan's gave was admiring, and Natalie was suddenly bashful.

    `N You're the most powerful wizard in the world, you could totally do that. Also one of the most politically influential people in Vailia, and smart, and...`

    Meghan shook her head. `Meghan And all I really want is to read my books and be left alone. They,` she gestured vaguely at the door, indicating the rest of the world, `Meghan just assume I'm going to marry some man. I mean, yes, I'll have a child eventually. Continuing the magic unbroken is more important than my preferences, but, just... <i>eventually.</i> Not now.`

    `N You like girls, then?`

  || Meghan/Serious
    That got Natalie a sour look. `Meghan I don't like girls either, so don't think...`

    Nat held up her hands. `N Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean it like that. Promise I'm not trying and get in your pants, I just wanted to make all those expectant looks sod off, and it seemed like you did too, so...` she trailed off hopefully.

    Meghan nodded, accepting the apology. `Meghan Let's talk about something else. Um... have you read Treatise on Historical Storm Patterns?`

    Natalie relaxed and gave a tentative smile. `N I think he's wrong about the causes, but it's an interesting thought, and very thorough research.`

    `N Your father died.` Natalie handed James the letter, gestured him to sit on her bed. He sat. `N I'm sorry.`

    `J What?`

    `N Your mother wrote me. She says you didn't respond last time she tried, and she doesn't know if you read her letters.`

    `J I visited her a few months ago.`

    `N Only after I harangued you into it. Anyway, I'm not here to accuse you of anything. I just wanted to let you know.`

    James held the letter delicately, as if afraid to wrinkle the paper. Hunched over, he unfolded the letter, considered it, folded it again without reading anything. Natalie studdied his face, looking for some clue as to his thoughts. When he got like this, it was impossible to tell what he was thinking. James' face wasn't carved from granite like his father's had been, but just... blank. He gave nothing away.

  || N/Embarrassed
    `N Come on James, talk to me.`

    `J How did it happen?`

    `N A fire. Maybe a spark from the smithy caught the roof or something, she doesn't know. Anyway, your house caught, and it was spreading across the neighborhood before Lady Meghan showed up and put out the whole thing. I just can't believe that much power in a mage, to...`

    `J Please, not now.`

    `N Yeah, sorry.` Natalie shifted uncomfortably in her chair. There was enough in there for him to deal with already, without adding his fear of magic into the mix. `N Anyway, your mother's staying with one of your uncles for now.`

    `J Christoph. He always writes letters for my par... for my mother.`

    `N Hm, wasn't he the tall thin fellow, runs a sawmill with his husband?`

    `J They're divorced now, but Christoph still works at the mill. They make better business partners than they did a couple.` A snort accompanied that last statement, and Natalie siezed that crack in his impasivity. She leaned forward, resting her chin in her hands. Bland details were fine - he was at least speaking with her, rather than pushing her out, brooding in silence.

    `N You're talking now, that's good. Keep doing that. So when are you going to go speak with your mother?`

  || J/Upset
    `J I don't know. The ship...`

    `N James Thadel!` Her sharp tone made him jump. `N I am your captain and your closest friend and sometimes I know you better than you know yourself. For all your problems with your father, he's dead now, and I won't let you use me as an excuse to avoid your mother. She wrote to <em>me</em>. Since when is she willing to acknowledge my existence? She needs your support. When are you going to see her?`

    James crossed his arms over his chest, shoulders hunched, then realizing what he was doing, uncrossed them and sat up straighter, the pose forced and uncomfortable. He took a deep breath and leaned back in the bed, head tilted up to watch the ceiling. They waited in silence, with the noise of the city filtering through layers of wood and tar to keep them company. Finally James let out a sigh and returned to the present.

    `J You're right, damn it, you're right.`

    `N I know I am.`

    He gave her a nasty look, and she snapped her mouth shut. `J I suppose now is as good a time as any.`

    She reached over and gave his shoulder a squeeze. <button onclick="Story.continueWith('JamesCh3Yes')">`N I'll come with you.`</button> <button onclick="Story.continueWith('JamesCh3No')">`N Take as much time as you need.`</button>

    <i>Going with him will commit you to James in Chapter 3, while sending him alone will lock out his route. No second chances.</i>

    `N I'll come with you. I haven't seen your mother in almost a year, and this way I can make sure you don't get lost on the way there.` She shook her head, regretting the hurt look her words had garnered. `N Sorry, sorry, I meant it as a joke, not an imprication.`

    `J I keep my word, Nat. Just let me grab some money, I can at least do that much for her.`

    Christoph Thadel's apartment was tucked away on the upper floor in the back corner of a tenement, curiously modest for someone who helped run a major business. Natalie pulled her away mind from money and waited quietly while James knocked. Clean, though. The smells inside the building were predominatly pleasant, cooking smoke, freshly sanded wood, soap. A hint of roasting chicken tickled their noses.

    A scarecrow of a man opened the door, all elbows and graceless height. ` James. And Miss Rowena, if I remember correctly,` he bowed to her. ` Please come in, we were just about to sit down for supper. Will you join us?`

    `J No. I just came to see...`

    `N We'd be delighted to stay, thank you.`

  ||
    Christoph looked between them, then nodded to Natalie. ` I'll set two more places. Melissa's in the bedroom, I imagine she'll be out in a moment.` He gestured them in and turned to the kitchen, leaving them temporarily alone.

    `J You're presuming an awful lot today, captain,` he growled at her. She pointedly ignored him and looked around the room. Well made furniture, mostly polished wood. Clean and tidy, tending towards dark and cozy.

    ` James?` His mother arrived, dark circles under her eyes, but expression brightening at the sight of her only son. She rushed over to hug him. Melissa was frailer than in Natalie's memories, a small, tired woman who rose only to her son's shoulder. She nearly vanished from sight when wrapped in his arms.

    As snappish as he'd been getting to this point, James embraced her without hesitation.

    ` I was worried you wouldn't come,` the muffled words emerged from James' shoulder.

    ` Miss, if you wouldn't mind?` Christoph rescued Natalie from spectating by offerring her a stack of plates to set out on the table. ` I was hoping James would drop by this evening, so I made something special.` In a lower voice just for her, ` Thank you for making him stay. Melissa needs him here right now. She and her husband lived in that home for almost twenty five years.`

  || N/Normal
    `N Isn't he her second husband?`

    He nodded, following her around the small table with a handful of silverware. On the other side of the room, James and his mother talked in low voices. James shook his head, refusing something she tried to hand him.

    ` She married very young the first time. This is the second husband she's outlived, and the house burning down at the same time has been a terrible blow.` They retreated to the kitchen, giving Melissa and her son more space.

    `N Does she need money? It's no hardship, we've had a run of successes lately.`

    ` No, thank you. Kind of you to offer, but there are enough Thadels for us to take care of our own. Forgive a relative his prying, but are you and James...?` He left the question open, but she quickly shook her head.

    `N Just friends. He's my first mate, but nothing more.`

    ` First mate?` Christoph's eyebrows rose. ` I heard he ran away to become a common sailor. And you a captain.`

    `N The Lapis Azurai is one of the finest ships in the city, and I couldn't run it without him.` Natalie had the sudden urge to boast on James' behalf, both feeling that it wouldn't be taken amiss and that she had to fill in whatever else his family hadn't seen fit to tell this uncle. `N I'm Guildmaster Janos' protege. I'll likely inherit a seat on the council, someday.`

    ` Huh. That's rather different than what I've heard about you.` He glanced over at Melissa, and Natalie thought she heard a muttered ` ...and somewhat more believable.` He shook his head and returned his attention to practical matters. ` I'll bring the food out if you all will sit down.`

  ||
    Whatever well of conversation James and his mother had tapped seemed to have run dry. Dinner was filled mostly with Christoph asking Natalie about their adventures and occasionally attempting to draw James into the conversation with questions about shipboard life. His efforts only yielded monosyllabic answers and the occasional shrug. The chicken was excellent, roasted and stuffed with carrots and potatoes, a welcome change from the stale fare that usually filled their diet at sea.

    As much as she hated to give up on the attempt to get James and his mother talking, to get James to acknowledge some feeling other than stoic indifference to his father's death, she just didn't have it in her to push harder. With plates picked clean and Natalie's last tale of distant shores finished, an awkward silence settled over the table. Although he'd agreed to come, James had put up a wall thicker than she could chip away alone, and Melissa's withdrawn and self-absorbed silence wasn't helping. Christoph caught her eye, silently asking for advice. She only shook her head, sighed. He nodded in sympathy.

    ` I'm sorry I don't have any dessert prepared, but I'd imagine you two have to get going soon. Time and tide, after all.`

    `N I'm afraid so.` Natalie and James rose from their places, gathered their coats from where they'd laid them near the door. `N Thank you for dinner, it was lovely.` Natalie hugged both Christoph and Melissa, the latter managing a wan smile. Though James's mother had always been civil with her, Natalie often wondered just what Melissa thought of her son's best friend, and suspected it wasn't all that flattering.

    `J Thank you for dinner. Christoph, mum.` James shook his uncle's hand, then hesitated before his mother. He settled for a hug, too long for James' taste and too short for Melissa's.

  ||
    They were out of the apartment and Natalie was halfway down the first flight of stairs when she noticed James was still standing at the top of the stairs, looking back at the closed door. She stopped, waited for him, hopeful.

    `J I... think I'd like to stay a bit longer. If you don't mind, Nat?`

    `N Not at all. Please. I'll go ahead.` She suppressed her reaction - smiling would have offended him at the moment. Instead she came back up, clapped him on the shoulder. Though she'd been needed to force this visit, her presence now would restrain the emotions that needed to come out. `N Don't stay up too late, we've got an early day tomorrow.` She pushed him back towards the door.

    `N And then when your father decided I took you away from him...` Natalie left unsaid the painful arguments they both remembered.

    Natalie patted his back. `N I do. Now, go talk with your mother. I'll be here when you get back if you want to talk more. Say hello to Christoph for me.`
