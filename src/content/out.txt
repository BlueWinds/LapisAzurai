    !! <center>Natalie dreamt of Fire.</center>

    <center>Not the tame fire of a lantern, or even the fierce danger of a forest fire. No, her dream was of Fire, the blaze with which the gods made the stars or with which they burned the skies and scorched the world clean at the dawn of an age.</center>

    <center>She also dreamt of Ocean, a vast and barren wasteland separating pinpricks of land. In her dream, she knew the ocean was waiting for her, waiting for her to see something no one else has ever seen before, and that no one would see again before storms wiped the land clean.</center>

    <center>And she dreamt of Love. Neither fire nor water, she finally had a body made of flesh, and in her heart grew a secret warmth that even the end of the world could not smother. Her secret love could neither be burned nor drowned, and it would flower into a beautiful life if only it would grow large enough, surrounded by chaos and flood and storm. She curled around it protectively.</center>

  || bg=travel/CabinDay speed=verySlow
    -- Thud.

    The dream ended abruptly as she fell off the bed. Groggy and disoriented, but definitely awake, she rubbed her head and opened her eyes. Morning light. She stumbled to her feet, grabbing the edge of her bed for support as the ship rocked beneath her. The roll of the Lapis Azurai was gentle, calming even, chasing away fraying fragments of her dreams and reminding her of where and who she was.

    She was on a ship. On her ship. Captain Natalie. She liked the sound of that. Provisional captain. If she brought it back from its maiden voyage she'd have earned the rank for real. If she didn't bring it back, well, not much use thinking about that. The ocean was not safe.

    -- Not her though. This was her ship. It would return safely, and not just the first time. Every time.

  || left=N/normal
    Grinning at the thought of herself in wrinkles and walking across the deck with a cane – as if! - she brushed copper strands out of her eyes and examined herself in the mirror, still groggy. She slapped her cheeks and stuck her tongue out at the reflection. There were old sailors and old captains, good enough or lucky enough, and she was going to be one of them. No cane though.

    -- `J Nat! You ok?` James called.

    `N Yeah, fine.`
    `J I heard you thumping around.`
    `N It's nothing. How much time do we have?` She splashed water on her face, dried it with a towel, then started looking for her boots.

    -- `J We should have left ten minutes ago!` He hadn't woken her up, though. Natalie had learned long ago that James would worry himself sick at the slightest excuse, but it wasn't until he was practically vibrating with impatience that she actually needed to hurry.

    || bg=travel/DeckDay speed=slow left=N/upset
    `N I don't believe you,` she opened the door and stepped out to join him on deck. `N You were rather drunk last night. How are your eyes not red?`

    Natalie poked James in the forehead, causing him to wince. `N I knew it, you just woke up too.`

    -- He shook his head, mop of hair unrully and uncombed, trying to deny it, but she quirked an eyebrow, and he finally relented. `J Hey, it was our very first night on board your new ship. A little drinking seemed in order.` He dropped his eyes guiltily.

    `N Never said it wasn't. Now, come on, I want breakfast before we meet with the Guildmaster.`

  The Guild.

  James hesitated at the doors, then hurried to join Natalie when she shot him an impatient look. The lobby was rather busy this morning, filled with preparations for the annual Festival of Lights, the longest day of the year made even longer by a celebration that ran until dawn.

  -- ` The Guildmaster is waiting for you in his office,` the young man at the front desk prompted, sounding a little envious. Natalie was barely a year older than him. That she'd have the attention of the Guildmaster was unusual, to say the least. He'd never even spoken with many of the "Guild Children."

  || left=N/normal
  `N Thanks. Light a candle for me,` she leaned over the desk and pinched his cheek. He was cute, but she couldn't remember his name. `N I'm going to have to miss the festival this year.`

  ` Will do, Nat,` he swatted away her hand with a grin. Envious or not, children lifted off the streets and raised together looked out for their own.

  -- Natalie entered the Guildmaster's office, trailed a moment later by James. She immediately went over and flopped into a seat across from him, while James hovered behind her nervously.

  || right=Guildmaster/normal
  Guildmaster Janos looked up from his reading and smiled at them. Though he had assistants to handle all the papers necessary, he still preferred to touch at least some of that work himself. Understanding the details and not merely the overview of the Guild's operations gave him important advantages, he'd once told her. Natalie briefly saw a column of figures – expenses, deposits – before he leaned forward, covering it with one arm.

  || right=Guildmaster/smiling
  -- `Guildmaster Please, I'm not going to bite. James Thadel, is it? I understand you're to be Natalie's first mate?`

  || left=J/embarrassed
  `J Sorry sir, yes sir.` James stood up straighter, self consciously moving out from his position half hidden behind her. `J Quartermaster,` he corrected.

  || right=Guildmaster/thinking
  -- `Guildmaster Please take as good care of her as we have.` He gestured to a pair of chairs in front of his desk. Natalie relaxed into hers, while James perched on the edge. It was his first time meeting Janos, and she couldn't help but chuckle at his nerves. She'd been awed too, her first time meeting the most powerful man in the city - but eight year old Natalie had gotten over that nervousness by promptly sitting in his lap, rather than the offered chair. She smiled at the memory. He'd approved, as Wend had said he would, rather than scolding her.

  || right=Guildmaster/normal
  `Guildmaster When do you set sail?` he went on.

  -- `N Soon. Two, three days. We've finished going over every inch of planking, and the initial trials around the island went well. If you see him, please thank Captain Johnson for assisting us with that.` `J Joneson,` James corrected, but she carried on without pause.

  `N I discussed prices for our first cargo with...` Natalie listed off the preparations she'd made for departure, while Janos listened attentively. His was one of the finest business minds in the city, and it comforted her to know that he would catch anything she'd forgotten. Which was, she suspected, the real point of this meeting.

  || right=Guildmaster/thinking
  `Guildmaster Very thorough. I have nothing more to add.` He jotted down a note.

  Natalie grinned at that, as much approval as he ever showed of anything. Impulsively she stood and leaned over the desk and planted a kiss on his cheek before he could say anything. She quickly retreated back to her seat, sitting on her hands lest they do anything else untoward.

  || right=Guildmaster/normal
  -- `Guildmaster Please let me know when you return.` He didn't react to her gesture, other than adjust a stack of papers, but she suspected he was pleased. Hard to tell, with the Guildmaster. She also knew a dismissal when she heard one.

  Natalie laid aside her pen and admonished James, looming in the doorway. `N If you're going to fill the room with dread, at least enter all the way.`

  He started guiltily and stepped into her cabin, closing the door behind him with a foot. He remained standing. Other than the chair she occupied, the only place to sit would be on her bed, and he wasn't the sort to be comfortable with that. The space was cramped, but a private room was still more than most people aboard a ship this size would get, even the quartermaster. He'd have to share a room with the first-mate, once they had one.

  -- `J Nat...` he trailed off, then started again. `J I'm not sure we're ready yet.`

  She waited for him to go on. He didn't, just fidgeted and leaned against the door, resisting the swell and roll of the deck beneath them. Timber creaked, adjusting to new stresses. `N What aren't we ready for?`

  `N We've hired a crew, loaded cargo and are planning to set sail in the morning. It's a bit late for second thoughts now.`

  -- `J It's just... I can't shake this feeling of doom. Do you know how many ships survive a storm? I did some figuring. The odds aren't pretty, if you get caught out at sea.`

  Natalie stood and moved over to the bed, patting the chair and indicating that he should take the seat. `N The Azurai is a good ship. She'll see us through. The shipwrights knew what they were doing when they built her. She may be small, but she's fast and sturdy.` She patted his knee, attempting to reassure him of something she wasn't entirely sure of herself.

  -- `J What are we even doing here, Natalie? There's plenty of opportunity at home, without risking your life.`

  `N You have a future in Vailia, and I never asked you to give it up. It's not my future. I don't have anyone to hand me a house and a trade, James. Do you know what I'd be doing, right now, if I weren't a captain?`

  -- Natalie was too small and too smart to desire any form of manual labor, and too poor to set herself up in any other trade.

  || left=J/embarrassed
  Red crept along his cheeks as he considered the question. Young, attractive, raised by the Guild... Really, there was only one answer to that question. She'd be selling her body, same as plenty of other Vailian girls her age pretty enough to make it a living. `J I, ah, sorry,` he apologized lamely.`

  -- `N Don't be. I chose this, you chose this, and if we'd chosen differently, we'd be different.` She poked his forehead, trying to break the mood before he turned into a beet. It had happened before, if she teased him about sex too much, but now wasn't the time.

  `J I suppose so,` he rubbed his forehead, rolled his shoulders, stood up. Despite his slight frame, Natalie knew just how strong he was – one wasn't born as a blacksmith's son without working up some strength.

  `N Have a good night. Stop worrying.` She looked away and picked up her pen again.

  `N What?` She slipped up out of bed, on her feet and shrugging on a shirt even while he answered. There was no light outside – still night. No, not night...

  || center=N/embarrassed
  `J A storm is rolling in! I've got the crew pulling up the sails, but it's eating the horizon like you wouldn't believe...` He stepped out of the way as she opened the door in his face.

  || bg=travel/DeckStorm
  -- In one direction lay a peaceful night – dark sky and twinkling stars, ocean quiet but growing rougher. In the other... she groaned.

  || left=N/shouting
  `N Strike the sails, lock down all the booms, get everyone else up,` she left the door swinging open and scrambled for something warmer to wear. Waxed cap, waxed jacket, stiff boots – everything she'd need for working outdoors in the worst weather the ocean could throw at them.

  || bg=travel/ShipStorm
  By the time she was dressed, the storm loomed almost overhead, howling winds whipping the water into a dark purple froth. Rain sleeted around them, drenching the deck and making everything slippery. The crew was already hard at work, battening everything down for a blow. She found James at the helm, pushed him aside and took the wheel herself.

  || left=N/uncertain
  -- `N Not good. It's a big one,` Natalie had to shout to be heard over the sound of the ocean.

  || right=J/angry
  `How do you know!?`

  || left=N/uncertain
  `N It's... it'll take five, six hours to blow past!` She tasted the wind, unfurling instincts seldom used. The first wave caught them from the side before she could turn the ship.

  || right=J/upset
  `J <b>How do you know!</b>` James repeated his question, grabbing her waist to steady her as the water washed over the deck below.

  ||
  -- Two sailors snapped to the end of their safety lines, saved by the rope anchoring them to their posts, while the rest remained on their feet. This one hadn't risen high enough to flood over the poop deck, but it was just a warm up. Looking deeper into the storm from their position at the top of the wave, they could see even more monstrous waves coming toward them. Natalie spun the wheel, hoping desperately that the ship would turn fast enough to take the next head-on.

  -- Storms like this swept across the world, leaving nothing but wreckage in their wake. Refuges like Mt. Julia were vital for any ships to survive at all. Seagoing vessels existed as fugitives, darting between safe ports in the intervening lulls. No captain set sail in anything except perfect weather, to reduce their chances of getting caught out. Like they had. And even still, as often as not, ships were unlucky. Like they were.

  -- Another wave towered over them, a tremendous mountain in the ocean. James managed to wrap a rope around Natalie's waist and tie it to the wheel just in time. This one didn't spill over the deck as more than a plume of spray, but surging water and gusting wind spun the ship around like a cork, and the deck tilted precipitously.

  || bg=travel/DeckStorm right=J/angry
  -- James shouted something at her, but Natalie couldn't hear what he said, drowned out by howling wind that hit them almost like a solid object. He pointed. One of the sailors hung limply from his line, blood running from his forehead. Natalie shook her head, made a sharp gesture of denial – James shouldn't go down there. He gritted his teeth and ignored her, untied his line and ran down the stairs.

  || bg=travel/ShipStorm
  -- This was the sort of storm that left no survivors. A Grandmother Storm. The last had been just a month ago. Natalie had helped comb the beach for wreckage and survivors in its wake. There were precious few of the latter, and far too much of the former.

  A wave towered over them, reaching halfway up the main mast for a brief moment before it crashed over the deck. Natalie clung to the wheel, fighting the maelstrom that tried to tear her away from her post. The Azurai popped out of the water on the other side, creaking timbers audible even over the sound of the wind. She checked the deck. James clung to one of the masts, holding the @sailor in one arm.

  -- Against all odds, she felt giddy, alive. Death was so close, and yet... and yet, it wouldn't claim them. She could feel it in her bones, taste it in the wind, smell it in the salt spray. Natalie felt the storm as though it were an extension of her own body, felt the howling power that fed it, felt a hundred miles of terrible elemental force seeking release...

  -- <h4>...</h4>

  || bg=travel/DeckStorm left=N/excited
  -- James looked up at the wheel where Natalie hung onto it, dazed, looking more like a drowned rat than his best friend. In the brief lull between waves, he saw... he rubbed his eyes. She was grinning like a madwoman. The sailor stirred in his arms.

  || bg=travel/CabinStorm
  He cut away the sailor's rope with a knife and dashed towards the door below decks, slamming it behind him just as another wall of water crashed over the ship. He leaned down, examined the man's forehead. Still breathing. Just a crack on the head. He'd be fine.

  || bg=travel/DeckStorm
  -- James pushed back into the storm, wind instantly cutting away any semblance of warmth he'd gathered inside. Clinging to the rail for stability against the violently pitching deck, he pushed his way back up to the poop deck. Natalie hadn't moved. She still clung to the wheel, grinning madly. He grabbed her shoulder, shouted something even he couldn't hear.

  || left=N/excited
  -- `N Do you know why they gave me a ship, James? I'm smart, and I'm pretty, but that's not why.` Her laughing voice somehow cut through the wind, though he could barely hear his own shouting. He shook his head. This wasn't the time for that.

  `They gave me a ship because I'm not going to die!` She let go of the wheel with one hand, gripped his shoulder with manic strength. Another wave crashed over the ship, burying them both in boiling, freezing foam for a moment. When it cleared, one of the sails had ripped away, floating in the ocean nearby, but the mast itself was still intact.

  -- James shook his head again, trying to clear it. That they hadn't sunk yet was nearly a miracle. Whatever manic state had come over her, Natalie was still alive, and still holding the wheel, turning as best she could to face each new assault from the storm. In a brief lull in the wind, he heard someone below shouting to get buckets and head below decks. He clasped her shoulder again and headed off to help.

  || speed=slow
  -- <h4>...</h4>

  || bg=travel/DeckNight speed=slow
  -- Silence.

  || right=J/upset
  James clung to the railing, shivering, and trying not to pass out from the twin pangs of exhaustion and chill. But he was alive. They were all alive, by some miracle. The sea still rolled, waves still occasionally rose high enough to spray the deck, but it was clear they'd passed through the worst of the storm. Light grew on the horizon - dawn, slowly pressing its way through the clouds overhead.

  -- He stumbled to his feet, slipped on a loose rope, steadied himself with an arm on the railing. Deep weariness penetrated all the way to his bones, sapping every ounce of strength. Just a little more. He dragged himself across the deck, slapping a sailor on the back where she doggedly passed on pails of water handed up from below decks.

  -- Up on the poop deck he found Natalie, passed out and still tied to the wheel.  Numb fingers fumbled with the rope, then he bypassed them by using a knife to cut her free. They had plenty of rope. He winced away from the contact. Unlike his own icy skin, she was burning hot to the touch, as if wracked by a terrible fever. Only the strength and steadiness of her breaths reassured him she wasn't on death's doorstep.

  || bg=travel/cabinNight
  -- He carried her down below decks, to her cabin. Against all odds, the interior was still dry. Even a Grandmother Storm that had snapped both masts and torn away every sail hadn't been a match for the rubber seal around the door to the captain's cabin.

  Efficiently he stripped her, all the way down to bare skin. Any other time he would have hesitated, or at the very least been blushing and mortified as he worked, but not now. Any feelings beyond mere practicality were gone, washed away somewhere in the last six hours.

  || bg=travel/cabinNight right=J/upset
  -- He pulled the sheets up around her neck, then a blanket, then fumbled another one from a chest to lay over her. She didn't stir. Her skin still burned.

  He slumped to the floor, his back to her bed, and waited.

  Waited.

  ` And she hasn't moved since?` The priest shook his head, trying to keep pace with the young man as he pushed his way through the crowd.

  || left=J/upset
  `J Right. She was burning hot at first, like a harsh fever, but she wasn't sweating at all, and looked perfectly comfortable.` James gave everyone apologetic looks as he bulled his way towards the ship, priest in tow, but didn't stop even when he knocked a sailor over and she began hurling curses in his direction.

  -- No one had expected a ship to come into dock the day after a Grandmother Storm, and even with two masts snapped, the Azurai was in remarkably good condition. No hands lost. That was news. News attracted crowds. Natalie would know how to deal with this, but that wasn't much help when Natalie was the thing that needed dealing with.

  James nodded to one of the crew, guarding the ship and looking somewhat overwhelmed. The quartemaster didn't have any answers to give about how they'd survived. He understodd nothing more than the sailors.

  || bg=travel/CabinDay
  -- Natalie looked exactly as she had yesterday, cheerful cheeks the perfect picture of health, chest rising and falling steadily. The priest glanced at James for permission, then knelt down next to her and put his ear to her chest. James wished he could sense magic, even the slightest bit, but his family had never displayed an inch of talent, no matter how far back they went. He had no way of telling a charlatan from a healer.

  Not that there was really any danger in that - the Ocean Father's temple was the largest in Vailia, and they'd have quickly chased away anyone standing in their sanctuary wearing their robes who didn't belong.

  -- After only a minute of listening to Natalie breathe, the priest shook his head as though to clear it and stood again. ` I'm afraid there is nothing I can do. Rest is the only solution, rest and time.`

  || left=J/upset
  `J Solution to what?` James pursed his lips, trying to dispel the previous thought. That it had been unfair of him to consider such a thing.
  The priest tilted his head, as though confused by the question. ` The shock.`

  -- James just stared, waiting for him to go on.
  ` Magical drain. She must be quite powerful, to bring your ship through a storm like that.` Seeing the confusion reflected in James' face, he finally deigned to explain. ` Your captain here is a sorceress. And as I said, quite a powerful one at that. I wouldn't dare touch storm-energy. It's amazing she survived, but she'll make a full recovery, given enough time.` He patted James' arm. ` No charge, since I didn't do anything. Please ask her to stop by our temple once she awakens, if she is so inclined.`

  The Guild building was fortified. James noted with some satisfaction that even though they had no <i>current</i> rivals for power in Vailia, they still kept the sharp edge that they'd used finally secure a monopoly on Vailian trading abroad a generation ago. He liked working for people like that - an institution you could count on to endure. He wondered if Natalie had ever noticed the metal gates ready to be dropped in the face of violence, and the way a guard - unobtrusive, but present - appraised him as he entered. Probably not. She didn't care about things like that.

  `J That's what I'm here for.` He accepted the parcel - wrapped in brown paper, tied with twine, sealed with the Guildmaster's emblem.

  Natalie took it and excitedly unwrapped her present, cracking the wax seal and untieing the twine. Inside... a notebook, wrapped in oiled leather and tied closed with another string. She opened it reverently to a random page. A map, precisely drawn and carefully annotated of the waters around Mt. Julia. Another page - lists of wind speeds, seasons, storm likelyhood in vicinity of Nonkenia.

  -- A tightly guarded secret - one of the Guild's rutters. Everything an enterprising captain needed to travel safely around the continental coast near Vailia and her allied cities. Or everything a rival needed to run their own shipping business without Guild sponsership or control. Precious almost beyond measure.

  Natalie's eyes sparkled as she started reading. She looked radiant, alive. James tried not to stare, and his heart beat faster when she reached over to squeeze his hand before returning to her reading. She didn't notice when he excused himself.

    She was a young woman, Kat's age, but otherwise completely unlike the thief. Piercingly beautiful, elegant, self-assured, she looked the part of a noblewoman. But as their eyes met...

  || speed=slow bg=places/GuildOfficeGrey right=Meghan/normal
    Power. The room was filled with it, And unlike the energy Natalie could harness in a storm, the power was already directed, contained, coiling around the girl and squeezing the air from Natalie's lungs.

  || speed=verySlow bg=places/GuildOfficeGrey2 right=Meghan/normal
    It wasn't hostile. It wasn't aimed at all. It merely... was, dimming the rest of the world with the mere weight of the girl's existence. Natalie's magic flickered like a candle in the presence of the sun, threatening to go out.

  || speed=slow bg=places/GuildOfficeGrey3 right=Meghan/normal
    Natalie couldn't breathe.

  || bg=places/GuildOffice right=Meghan/happy
    The girl smiled, and the pressure vanished, magic coiling back inside, waiting until called forth again. Natalie staggered with the sudden change in atmosphere and sat on down hard, hands folded in her lap. The display - clearly, that's what it had been - had worked. She was overawed and cowed.

  || left=Guildmaster/normal right=Meghan/happy
    ` Natalie Rowena, allow me to introduce Lady Vailia.`

  || left=Guildmaster/normal right=Meghan/normal
    ` Just Meghan, please.`

  || left=Guildmaster/serious right=Meghan/normal
    ` Lady Meghan, then. She wanted to meet you, and I suggested that since you were already making the trip up here, she could join us.` Though the Guildmaster's neutral expression had flickered into a frown for only a moment, Natalie could read between the lines perfectly well - he hadn't wanted to introduce them at all. For Natalie's protection, or for some other reason?

  || left=N/normal right=Meghan/normal
    `N Named after the city?` As curiosity overcame dread, she realized what this meeting was - a test. She hoped she hadn't failed already.

  || left=N/normal right=Meghan/happy
    ` Other way around.` Meghan shrugged.

  || right=Guildmaster/serious
    ` Lady Meghan came of age a few weeks ago. I would have invited you to the celebration, but you were at sea,` Janos interjected. ` Her father was a good friend of mine.` <i>But she isn't</i> was implied.

  || left=N/normal right=Meghan/happy
    ` It has been some time since our city hosted a sorceress of your power.`

  || left=N/excited right=Meghan/happy
    Natalie laughed. "Of your power." This girl could squash her like a bug. Rumors had it that Vailia was home to the most powerful sorcerers in the world. No way this could be anyone other than his daughter. Magic traveled in the blood, and, some said, grew with each unbroken generation.

  || left=N/normal right=Meghan/happy
    `N Are you really the most powerful mage in the world?`

  || left=N/normal right=Meghan/normal
    ` The world is a big place.`

    `N That's a yes in disguise, isn't it?`

    Meghan shrugged, but Natalie could tell she was pleased. Score one point for reading the girl's attitude correctly. Outright flattery would have gotten nowhere with someone so used to power, but curiosity and blunt truth had been the right approach.

  || left=N/normal right=Meghan/serious
    ` Who were your parents?`

    `N My mother worked for the Guild, Jessie Rowena. I don't know who my father is.`

  || left=N/normal right=Meghan/normal
    ` What day were you born?`

    `N 15th of Descending Fire, 1274.`

    ` Are you planning on having children any time soon?`

    `N No plans in that direction.`

  || left=N/normal right=Meghan/serious
    Meghan pursed her lips. Natalie felt magic stir for a moment, brushing past her mind in a movement too swift and subtle to follow. Then Meghan relaxed again, and sunk back in her chair with a smile.

  || left=N/normal right=Meghan/normal
    ` Kantis.`

    `N What?`

    ` Kantis. Yea bear Kantian magic. You will need to take care if you ever visit.` Meghan nodded sharply and stood. ` Thank you for your time, Natalie, Guildmaster. Take care.` She took her leave without waiting for a response.

  || speed=slow left=N/normal right=Guildmaster/thinking
    With the Guildmaster and Natalie left alone, silence filled the room. Natalie watched Janos, trying to figure what he made of the visit. For her own part Natalie was inclined to dismiss it as merely Meghan assessing the threat of another mage in the city, but the Guildmaster had a far broader view of events than she did, and if there were political implications in Lady Vailia taking an interest in one of the Guild's captains, he'd be the one to know.

    ` I had other things to discuss with you, but my business will have to wait for another day. I need to think on this.`

    `N Is the city really named after a family of mages?`

    ` Yes. I'm sure you can read about it at the library.`

  Excited shouts and waving arms guided the Azurai into dock at Alkenia, one of Vailia's primary trading partners. Another free city, Alkenia nestled in the arms of an encircling mountain, stone bluffs trailing into the sea on either side of the city and providing protection from storms. A stream ran down the valley though the center of town fed by springs further up the slope. The Alkenians made their livings from the forest and the shore, supplying Vailia with timber in return for steady shipments manufactured goods or other items from farther afield. Without the vast and relatively safe forests, Natalie's homeland would be unable to keep a significant navy afloat against the terrible attrition of the open ocean.

  -- For those reasons, and others, the arrival of a ship from the east was always a welcome sight. A gaggle of children stood gaping at them as sailors hopped down from the Azurai and began to secure it to the wharf. A man bearing a clipboard and a pen waited patiently for Natalie to disembark.

  The instant he set foot on the dock James was swarmed by children. Looking somewhat bewildered as he tried to answer their queries all at once. He looked at Natalie for help, but she just waved with one hand and smiled.

  `N No, thank you. A local guide would not be amiss, but I wouldn't want to impose.`
  ` I'm sure any one of the little scoundrels harassing your husband would be happy to help.

  Alkenia's market was a crowded place, stalls buying and selling almost every imaginable good. Though, Natalie noted, the prices were often somewhat inflated compared to what one would pay in Vailia itself. She had never before had enough money to consider most of the items on sale, or at least not had the intention to spend that much money. She was too busy saving up for her grand adventure. Now, though... now she could sample whatever she liked and call it a business expense. A merchant had to know what, exactly, they were selling, after all!

  -- The aroma of a spice rack drew her irresistibly towards it. Most of the scents she could at least identify, but not one that stood out.

  ` Sin-namon. You're smelling sin-namon,` the merchant smiled at her twitching nose. ` Special import. I hear tell it comes from beyond Kantis, north and east so far I didn't even recognize the name of the country. Amazing, isn't it?`

  || left=N/normal
  Natalie leaned close to the jar. It had a perforated top and sat over a candle to spread the smell as far as possible. A dirty trick, but effective advertising none the less - it had certainly worked on her. `N It does smell marvelous. What is it?`

  ` Tree bark. Boil it or grind it up. 10 obols an ounce, but a little goes a long way. Limited supplies.` He gestured to a single, half empty crate behind him.

  Natalie whistled at that. Truly it must come from halfway around the world to warrant that price – or he was a con artist, and a splendid one. The smell though - she'd never scented anything like it in her life, nor heard of it. A cargo hold full of that and she'd be set for life. Vailia would eat it up. `N Interesting. Does it taste like it smells? I might consider...`

  -- A flash of movement caught her eye, and a sudden feeling of a breeze. She patted her pocket, and found no bundle of coins. She spun on her heels, catching another flash of motion: a young woman, disappearing into the crowd.

  || left=N/shouting
  `N Pickpocket!` Natalie shouted. Heads turned, a path cleared for to give chase, but too late. The girl was gone, lost somewhere in the crowd.

  She managed to catch the young woman in the side of the head with a fist. The blow dazed her, and Natalie took the opportunity to wrap an arm around her neck, bending her over and holding her firmly in place. Natalie wasn't the strongest woman, but compared to her the pickpocket might as well have been a feather.

  || right=K/upset
  A feather that fought dirty. She stomped on Natalie's toes (only mildly effective through thick ship-boots), then elbowed her in the stomach (quite effective through a thin shirt), and shoved her way free in the sudden confusion.

  -- The guard shook the girl's bag. It rattled with the sound of silverware. ` If I talk to the woman selling these, am I going to find they were bought properly, Kat?` He seemed to know her, and the exasperated tone of his voice suggested this was not the first such incident. ` Is she going to be able to tell me what's in your bag better than you can?`

  Natalie arrived early at the courthouse – one of two in Alkenia, and by far the poorest and busiest. This one handled justice for those neither wealthy nor influential enough to arrange trial away from all the noise and bustle.

  -- She found herself packed in a waiting room with a crowd of supplicants, each waiting their turn before the judge. One could expect no more than fifteen minutes for their complaint heard, case judged, or contract enforced here. Too many waited, or dreaded, their chance at justice for any single case to take long. For someone like Kat, clearly a child of the streets and with eyewitness testimony against her, the "guilty" verdict was a foregone conclusion. The only thing still to be decided was her punishment.

  As she hurried back towards the ship, coat pulled close around her, a hint of movement on the mostly deserted street caught her attention. A form, legs pulled up to its chest, half-hidden in the alleyway. There were people living on the street to be sure, but this... Natalie went over for a closer look.

She looked absolutely miserable, huddled up in a corner by the side of the street, raggedy blanket more hole than cloth draped over hunched shoulders. Natalie couldn't blame her.

If the current wind held steady, the Lapis would arrive just after midnight – enough time for everyone to rest and catch their breath before exploring the city in the morning. A week of sailing had settled the crew into a comfortable routine. James often took the night shift, watching the helm while the captain slept, and some of the more experienced sailors were finally starting to warm up tho Natalie and respect her judgement.

  Though the crew was still perhaps a little small should they encounter rough weather, they'd done admirably so far. They'd also been lucky, sailing in clear weather and steady wind - an auspicious beginning for a first voyage. Hopefully the trip home would be as smooth.

  -- `N Tell James what you were telling me last night,` Natalie waved over one of the sailors and her Quartermaster. He saluted the officers, bringing a smile to Natalie's face – she loved that feeling – and began again.

  || right=SailorMale/normal
  ` Mount Julia's not much more than a couple of warehouses, some wharves and an inn. I last sailed here about two years ago, and I don't imagine much has changed. The area's too rugged to support a real town, and there are... things... in the forset, but the natural harbor is such a good layover on the way out from Vailia that only idiots don't take the chance to top off supplies and rest a night on shore. Begging your pardon, ma'am,` he repeated the salute.

  || left=N/normal
  -- `N Don't worry, we'll be staying at least a day. Thank you,` Natalie waved him away. To James, `N I'm intending to sell our cargo here, rather than haul it further. Slim profit, but I want to take this first trip easy. We've been lucky with the weather. Let's not push it before we have a chance to debrief and hire more crew.`

  || right=J/normal
  `J I'll get everything cleaned up and check over the ship while you find a buyer.` He nodded, glancing behind them at the cargo hold. Several items hadn't been secured properly in the haste to depart, and one cask of fresh water had sprung a leak from the banging around.

  || left=N/normal
  -- `Good. I hardly expect to make more on this trip than I've spent in supplies and wages, but it'll be worth it for a shakedown cruise. Let's not waste time.`

  The Azurai shouldn't have taken any damage from such a minor voyage in calm weather, but it didn't hurt to check. James stripped down to his trunks – any issues would begin below the waterline on the outside of the hull long before they became visible to the occupants.

  He shook his head as someone whistled behind him, but he refused to dignify the catcall with a glance. Let Natalie have her fun. Or one of the sailors, if they were so bold. He didn't really want to know who it was. Yes he did, actually, but he still wasn't going to turn his head to look.

  -- He dove over the rail, hitting the icy water with nary a splash. The ocean water stung his open eyes for a moment, but he spun around and began inspecting the hull for damage without surfacing. No child in Vailia avoided learning to swim – if not intentionally, then at least when older children threw you over a cliff into the ocean.

  -- `J Nothing. We're clean.` James accepted the towel from a sailor, tussling it through his hair and rubbing the water off his back. No scrapes, no barnacles, no leaks.  The Guild hadn't skimped in giving Natalie a good vessel. The Lapis Azurai was a solid ship, straight out of the Vailian shipyards, not some rickety junk from Kantis. If there were ships anywhere in the world to match Vailian ones, even rumor hadn't reached James' ears.

  Natalie stood up suddenly, hair prickling along the back of her neck. It felt... it felt like a storm, but not a storm. Powerful magic was being unleashed nearby. She threw open her door and dashed on-deck.

  || bg=travel/deckNight
  -- It wasn't hard to find the source, with the entire crew staring in one direction. A distant pillar of silvery flames burned up from the horizon, tiny with distance, but huge to be visible so far out to sea. And intense. It cast shadows.
  `N All hands on deck!` She shouted, rousing those - like James - who hadn't yet appeared, and to stop everyone staring and start them moving. `N We're going to investigate.`

  || right=J/normal
  `J Nat?` James came up beside her, still shrugging on his boots. He rubbed sleep from his eyes. `J What is it?`

  || left=N/normal
  -- `N It's...` She hesitated, not really wanting to explain. The flames drew her eyes – she could hardly look away. It was the stuff of her nightmares. She knew that color, had dreamt those silver flames engulfing the world. But somehow... somehow they didn't feel dangerous, right now. Desperate, not dangerous.

  || right=J/normal
  `J Nat?`
  She shook herself free of the dream's grip. `J It'll be fine.`
  He shook his head at the non-answer. and turned to help with the anchor.

  || bg=travel/sailingNight
  -- The beacon lasted for half an hour before guttering out, and with it the sense of magic at play, but by that time Natalie had a good enough idea of its location to guide the Azurai. She knew they were getting close when they first sighted debris – shattered and burned wood, ash-blackened taters of rope.

  -- They slowed, moving through the field of detritus, first finding only splinters, then fragments of board and then bodies. Not survivors, clearly – they floated face down in the water, as burned and shattered as their vessel around them. The Azurai nosed aside a broken mast.

  Finally, at the center of the devastation, they found something. Sweeping a lantern beam across the water, James let out a cry and pointed. Amid the ocean of blackened soot and rent wood, a flash of white – a body, naked and seemingly unharmed. They drew it out of the water with a net.

  || bg=travel/deckNight
  -- A survivor. She coughed and shuddered as they lowered her on the deck, then lay still. A young woman – barely more than a girl – slender and pale-skinned, completely naked except for a metal collar and a manacles binding her wrists and ankles. The metal was twisted and warped, as though it had melted hot enough to start dripping over her bare flesh.

  Natalie draped a blanket over her, reached down to feel her forehead. She flinched away from the touch, and Natalie withdrew her hand. James reached down to pick her up, provoking a much more violent reaction – the girl moaned painfully, curled up into a ball beneath the blanket and began to sob.

  -- Everyone looked around uncertainly – surely they couldn't just leave her there on the deck – until Natalie shook her head and took charge again. `N Get us out of here and back towards Mt. Julia. James, I don't care if she shrieks, bring her to my cabin.`

  || bg=travel/cabinNight
  -- The girl struggled feebly in James' arms and sobbed horridly, but he did as ordered, grimacing at the horrid sobs provoked by his touch.

  Natalie drew aside the blankets as he lay the girl in her bed. She leaned in and, again despite the girl's feeble protests, held her wrists to examine the manacles. They were meant to be bolted to a wall, and probably had been until... something. Though the steel had bubbled and dripped, the skin beneath wasn't even red. Natalie drew the blanket up over her again, hiding her nakedness. She gestured, and they stepped back out on deck, closing the door behind them.

  The Azurai's passenger had nightmares. Terrible, screaming terrors that roused the whole ship before Natalie could sahke her free of them, though the physical contact seemed to reinforce the fear rather than assuage it. Still, Natalie figured, passing out from terror and resting peacefully must be better for her recovery than thrashing and screaming. It became a nightly routine.

  -- Her bruises healed with amazing speed, fading from fresh red to purple and yellow in a single day, gone entirely by the end of the second. Though they'd have liked to free her hands and feet, until she stopped moaning and struggling at any human touch, no one was willing to force the issue.

  -- It took longer than that before their passenger woke enough to do more than take a few sips of water or broth and pass out again. Natalie was plotting their progress on a chart when she heard a sound behind her, a shifting of cloth and a rustle of movement... the links of the manacles descended around her throat, threatening to choke her. Only threatening – they were tight but not yet difficult to breathe around.

  `N Please, I only want to hel-hurk...` Natalie's voice was choked off mid-sound, though the chain relaxed again soon after. Despite the danger in the situation, she couldn't help but notice the naked body pressed against her back, hot breath tickling her ear.
  `A I'll snap your neck if you scream,` the girl's voice was a hoarse hiss in her ear, accent strong but perfectly understandable.

  -- Natalie nodded, feeling the strength in her captor's hold, irresistable despite the fact that the threatener was centimeters shorter.
  `A What do you want from me?`
  `N I want-` the chain strangled her again briefly, and she gasped for breath when she could. Natalie continued more quietly. `N I want to help. We rescued you from the wreckage.`

  || right=A/normal
  -- That seemed to satisfy her. The chain relaxed around Natalie's neck, then  the girl stepped back, all sense of menace fading. Natalie stood and turned to face her. She huddled back against the bed, arms crossed over her breasts and looking quite thoroughly miserable.

  || left=N/normal
  `N Here, let me get you a robe.` Natalie dug through her closet, and produced a black nightgown to drape over the girl's shoulders.

  ||
  -- `J Nat, everything alright?` James knocked lightly on the door. The girl jerked at the sound, then calmed a little as Natalie held up her hands reassuringly.

  || left=N/normal
  `N Fine, fine. Bring breakfast for two, would you?` Back to her skittish and no-longer-nude guest, `N What's your name?`

  || right=A/normal
  `A A... Asara.` She looked both scared and hopeful as she said the name, as though it should mean something all by itself without explanation.

  || left=N/normal
  -- `N I'm Natalie. We're a merchant ship, currently docked at Mt. Vailia...` Her guest seemed to relax slightly, her shoulders losing some of the tension that had marked her posture so far. Sensing that it wasn't the content of the words so much as the mere act of friendly conversation, Natalie continued her introduction, starting with herself and widening out to the ship, the rest of the crew, Vailia... really, she just kept talking about anything and everything, initially with purpose and then just rambling about whatever came to mind to keep up the stream of words.

  -- James delivered the meal, but Natalie accepted it through a cracked door and shook her head in answer to his wordless questions – later – and closed the door on him.
  Asara flinched as Natalie came too close with the food, so she instead set it on the bed and gestured her guest to pick it up. Asara did so, but didn't take a bite of the bread until she'd seen Natalie swallow hers first.

  -- While they ate in silence, except the clanking of chains, Natalie finally had a chance to examine her Asara while awake. She wasn't as delicate as she'd seemed while sleeping – her arms had strength, and wasn't afraid to use it violently. Her entire aspect was controlled, no wasted movements or unconscious gesturing. Dangerous. Natalie didn't doubt the girl could and would have killed her had her earlier answers proven unsatisfactory. Asara noticed her staring, and Natalie looked away.

  || right=A/normal
  -- `A Please remove these,` She set aside the half finished buttered-roll and rattled her chains. She didn't make a face – she made very few expressions – but Natalie could tell that she didn't like the taste.

  || bg=travel/deckDay left=N/normal
  `N Of course, sorry, let's go below to where the tools are.` Natalie opened tho door and stepped out – several of the crew were around and looked at her curiously, but quickly scattered when she gestured them to clear the area. Asara hesitated at the doorway, then stepped out onto the deck. She glanced around, then nodded approval at Natalie to lead the way.

  -- In the cargo hold, James had anticipated their need, and had ready a chisel and hammer. Poking her head through the door, Asara saw him, sucked a breath through her teeth and retreated back on deck.

  `N What's wrong?`

  `A Please find me clothing.`

  -- `N You can't put on a shirt or pants until we break the links. It'll be just a moment...` Natalie trailed off as the girl closed her eyes and took in a deep breath. She was trembling. `N ...we can work out something. A wrap, maybe. Better than a robe draped over you.` She patted Asara on one shoulder. A mistake – their guest burst into tears, and fled back to the safety of Natalie's room, slamming the door behind her.

  ||
  -- Natalie stood outside her cabin, listening to her sobs. Eventually, it was too painful – she knocked, lightly. `N I'm sorry, we don't have to go down there. I'll bring the tools up, and we can do it in there...` No response. She sat down, back to the door and waited, cradling her head in her hands. James checked on her, but she waved him quiet before he spoke – it had been the sight of him that set Asara off in the first place.

    Natalie grinned and waved at the young man at the front desk, but didn't stop – no time to chat, only time to pause and shake water out her hair. Without James here to tug at her wrist she was running rather late, despite having given herself plenty of time to arrive. She hurried along the familiar corridors towards Janos' office.

Apparently he meant to finish whatever business he was attending before inviting her in. Natalie sighed and went over to a window. The view was impressive, looking down over the city. The Lapis was just barely visible from here. She tapped her foot on the polished wood floor, ran her finger along the windowsill (not as spotless as she'd kept it, when cleaning this office had been her job), and waited.

    Ten minutes later the door opened, and a weary looking Guildmaster held it for his guests. A stern looking older woman nodded as Natalie as she brushed past, decked in a foreign and formal dress. Janos' knuckles whitened on the doorframe, and he didn't so much as glance at Natalie as he watched the woman move sedately down the long hallway.

    -- `N Alkenia, yes sir. Would you like me to tell you about it?` She had guessed his intentions correctly, and he nodded. `N It's doing well.

    -- He grilled her briefly on the prices of various goods, quantities and qualities that she'd seen for sale. It was amazing the way he seemed to soak up information, fitting new facts into some sort of masterful puzzle only he could see. Finally, he gestured her to silence while he pondered the way the pieces fell together.

The advice was, she could guess, to be her means of payment for the mission. That, and a rutter to Kantis.

    `Guildmaster Something more like her father.` He saw the subtle widening of her eyes at that, quickly supressed. He smiled. Though he'd been the one startled when she'd seemed to appear from thin air, now that he'd had a minute to observe her, he could see that she was practially vibrating with tension. `Guildmaster Please do not be so nervous.

The lack of attention - positive or negative - was unnerving. She was here on Natalie's business. She'd spoken with the ruler of this place, the one they called Guildmaster.

He was rough-faced, at least six feet tall, and wore a broadsword strapped to his back. There was no denying that this was Torril, one of the more famous mercenaries in Vailia, now retired. Sitting and drinking in the rain, for some reason, rather than under the awning only a few steps behind him.

    ` I do. I take it you're interested?`

    `I captain a vessel and figured it would behoove me to know a thing or two more about this than I do.` She popped back to her feet and went over to the rack of wooden practice weapons, staying dry under the awning. She settled almost immediately on a narrow wooden blade. It felt ungainly and awkward in her hand.

    Torril stood up slowly, unfolding his bulky six feet, shaking his head and sending drops scattering from his hair. ` I have literally never had to tell someone which end of a sword was which before. Here, that's the grip on the other end...`

Her house was entriely out of place with its surroundings, a tiny little cot nestled among tremendous mansions, only two blocks from the palace itself. The inside was even more out of place - crammed with books, doodads and trinkets, it looked like it hadn't seen the hand of a maid in... well, ever. `Meghan I'm glad you came.

It was... where had all the energy for that <i>come from</i>? To draw that much power internally would have left Natalie half-delirious with magical strain, and Lady Meghan had done it idly, without thought. Natalie was impressed.

She found her book, and began flipping through it. Kat and Natalie waited in silence.

    `Meghan Ah, here we are. Rheia Vailia. Yes, she'd just survived the end of an age. That was a bad turning.` Meghan shook her head and replaced the book on her shelf.

    Before she could get there though, Janos swept in and took her other arm, tugging her away. `Guildmaster Oh, Natalie, just the person I was looking forward to seeing tonight.` Natalie flashed James an appologetic look for leaving him alone, and let the Guildmaster pull her away.

    `N I appreciate all you've done for me, sir, but I'll having no more truck with this particular plan of yours than she will.` Natalie gestured towards the center of the garden, where a regular flock of smartly dressed young men clustered around a thoroughly miserable Lady Meghan.

    `N Come on, back to the ship with you.`

    -- `J That's... have I mentioned recently how much I admire you, Nat? Anything I can help with?`

    `N I'm Janos' protege - I can get away with this. You though, they'd hang you out to dry. You can watch, but go back to the ship afterwards and don't stop to talk to anyone. Especially not the Guildmaster.` She took the drink he'd acquired from his hand and drained it in one gulp.

    James nodded, eyes shining, and took the glass back from her, stepping back into the crowd and leaving her alone.

    -- Natalie took a deep breath, then stepped towards the crowd surrounding Meghan.

    She cleared her throat. Meghan looked at her, and slowly the suitors turned in her direction.

    `N Lady Meghan VAilia.` She caugh Meghan's eye - Natalie couldn't wink, with all eyes on her, but she tried to make her tone sparkle, and hoped the lady would play along.

    `Meghan Yes, Natalie Rowena?`

    -- Natalie wanted to sag to her knees in relief, but held herself still instead. Meghan's twinkling eye reassured her that she'd read the situation right. If Meghan hadn't decided to play along, this would have resulted in Natalie making a fool of herself. With the other young woman's help, though, she could make a fool of everyone else here instead.

    `N I have proposition to discuss.` Stunned silence rippled across the party.

    `Meghan I would be delighted to hear it.` She held out her hand in courtly fashion, and taking swift strides across the path that had opened for her, Natalie took it with a bow.

    -- `N Shall we retire to your apartment, my lady?` She kissed Meghan's fingers.

    `Meghan Please.`

    Natalie hadn't thought the silence could grow more complete, but it had. She no intention of actually proposing marriage, but almost ruined the whole thing by bursting out laughing at the stunned expressions on almost every face. Even the Guildmaster had the decency to look nonplussed.

    Escorting the maiden in whose honor the party had been thrown, Natalie made her exit to the sound of a pin dropping.

While Colinth's docks teamed with fishing boats, cutters, and other ships of the Lapis' class, all of them moved around several hulking giants, clearly ships of war. Catapaults mounted on deck, tripple banks of oars, high fore and aft castles with arrow slits... Vailia had nothing like them.

    -- While he mulled it over, Natalie realized why the amulet hurt - it was tugging on her own power, and she'd reflexively raised it to protect herself. Using her own magic always brought pain. No wonked Kat hadn't felt anything.

    `K You like it?` Kat leaned close and whispered in her ear, apparently noting the way she was staring at the amulet.

    `N No! It hurts. It's magic.` She wanted to flick Kat's cheek, wipe off the speculative look that crossed her face, but instead had to turn attention back to the merchant. With the amulet. Which hurt to think about. `N I can't go lower than 50%, but I can certainly cut you in for half of the profit if it does go well. I'm looking to hedge the risk here, and that shouldn't be an issue if you're confident they'll keep properly on the voyage.` She fell back into haggling while Kat continued to stare at the amulet in a way that Nat tried to convince herself <i>didn't</i> mean she was going to steal it later.

    `N You didn't.`

    `K I totally did. Here.` Kat swung the amulet by its chain, staring at the stolen jewelry. She liked the red stone.

    `N You should give it back. I don't like it.` Natalie was rubbing her head the same way as she had been in the shop before.

    Kat grinned at her, giving her best 'I'm not sorry and you can't make me be' look, the one that Natalie found both exhasperating and endearing. She opened her mouth to chide her crew member more, but Kat shut her up by tossing the amulet to her. `K I want to know what it is, before you make me give it back to him.`

    -- Reflexively, Natalie caught it. White-hot light blazed from the captain's hand, and she whimpered. The light grew brigther, and Natalie screamed.

    Kat grabbed the pendant out of her hand, and the light vanished. Natalie slumped in her chair, breathing heavily. `K Are... are you ok?`

    `N Take it back to him,` Natalie managed. She whimpered and pulled her knees up to her chest as Kat leaned forward, accidentally bringing the amulet close to her again.

    Kat hesitated a moment, torn between the impulses, then firmed her resolve and ran to do as she was told.

  || bg=travel/DeckNight
    -- Her own breath was catching now, hoping against hope that Natalie was ok, wondering if it was ok to just leave her alone, cursing her own self-absorption... she nearly ran into Asara, who was running in the opposite direction, towards Natalie's cabin. Her first impulse was to shove the amulet into Asara's hands, tell her to deal with it, but even half panicked, she remembered that it might hurt Asara too, if it didn't like magic, and...

    A grip like iron descended on her shoulder, bringing her thoughts to a screeching halt. `A Who does it belong to?`

    `K I, it... it's the third house on the left, the big avenue eastward from the fish market, and...`

    The amulet didn't react when Asara took it from Kat's hand. Asara just shook her head, examining it. `A I will return it. You should not interfere with things you do not understand.`

    Kat raised her head, a sudden surge of annoyance that Asara would continue to remain mysterious when Natalie's life was one on the line, but there was no one to shout at. She was alone on the deck again, Asara already gone.

  || bg=travel/CabinNight
    -- `N I'm fine,` Natalie greeted her as she returned to the room. A little quiver remained to give lie to her words, but still, it was a big improvement from curled up in a ball. `N It stopped hurting as soon as you took it out of the room.`

    `K What was it?` Kat hugged her arms across her chest, uncertain voice barely above a whisper.

    `N I don't know. It just... it tried to taste my magic or something, and I resisted, which hurt. My power read that as an attack, and hit back, which hurt more, and, well, ouch.` She rubbed her forehead, then seeing the non-comprehension on Kat's face, `N I'm not sure why, but it's always hurt to use my powers. Usually it's under my control, so I'm expecting it and can brace myself, but...` She shrugged helplessly. `N Honestly, I'm not even sure the amulet was hostile. I think my lack of skill just caused a vicious cycle which spiraled out of control.`

    `K That's...` Kat hesitated, then threw her arms around Natalie, burying her head in the other woman's neck. `K I was so scared.`

    Natalie shielded her eyes from the sun and hugged her jacket closer around her. Wind bit through the cloth, whipped her hair into her eyes, blew grit into her mouth if she opened it at the wrong moment. How a place could be both so blindingly bright and yet so cold at the same time was a mystery to her, one she had no real desire to solve. Finally, in frustration, she pulled on a storm-cap just to keep her hair out of her eyes.

    Asara lifted her arms to the breeze and closed her eyes, a pleasant half smile on her lips.

    -- There wasn't a single plant in sight anywhere in sight, dark sand unbroken except for a stone pier and single small warehouse sticking out into the water. Half a dozen people waited for them on there, ropes in hand to help them dock against the wind. A hundred yards back from the water rose cliffs, sheer and of the same dark tan stone as the beach, a hundred feet high. A path had been laborously cut into the side of the cliff, narrow and treacherous switchbacks. Against the dusty sky Natalie could see buildings at the top - that must be the main camp.

    -- The Lapis nosed against the pier, bobbing in choppy water and gusty, unpredictable wind. While the crew tied it down with ropes tossed up from the dock, Natalie hopped over to speak with the woman in charge. Asara and James followed.

  || right=Cara/normal
    The woman was rough, as tall as James and heavier, weather beaten and tanned. Her appearance reflected the whole camp, aged despite still being young. She passed off the line she was hauling on to one of her teamsters as the three officers approached, turning to greet them. `Cara Tell your crew to stay on the ship or get up on the cliffs as soon as they're done mooring. I'm Cara,` she yelled at Natalie to be heard over the wind and extended a hand to shake. Natalie waved James back to the ship to make sure everyone heard. Cara's grip was crushing. They ran for the warehouse, a good place for a short conversation before the arduous trek up the cliff.

    -- `Cara Now, I know you're not an idiot, no captain is, but I'm going to give you the same lecture I give all the new miners, so you can repeat it to your crew. I don't want anyone getting hurt and saying I didn't warn you, ok?`

    `N Got it. I'm Natalie Rowena, nice to meet you.`

  || left=N/normal right=Cara/serious
    -- `Cara That's nice, now shut up and listen. The sand here eats at everything, and it gets in everywhere. It'll burn bare skin right quick. Don't walk in sand unless you have to, wear heavy boots, iron-shod is best. If I catch anyone in short sleeves, I'll throw 'em off the cliff myself. Sweep off your deck every night, and sweep out any room you're going to sleep in. It's not as bad up on the cliffs, so stay up there as much as you can. Now the nice bit is that there're no pests and no dangerous creatures, so don't worry about that even though we're awefully exposed without a wall - humans and our donkeys are the only things that can live here. Also no spirits and no demons. They don't like the sand any more than plants do. You can go anywhere you like, but you're an idiot if you go anywhere except the dock and the camp. Clear?`

    They both turned to look at Asara, who had cracked open the door and was looking outside.

    `A Of course there are spirits. Why do you think the sand eats at you? They are very hungry.` She closed the door again and leaned back against it. `A It reminds me of home. I am glad there are no demons though. How long can we stay here, Natalie?`

    She stood up from her chair. Natalie couldn't tower over him, but she could certainly press him back against the door with her unfair words. `N I was eight, when I learned. Could you have kept that secret for me? Not even hinted at it to your parents, when you were eight fucking years old?`

  || left=J/upset right=N/shouting
    -- James didn't get angry. He just looked uncomfortable and hurt, and somehow that only fueled Natalie's anger. She screamed something and punched his chest, unable to find any better way to express herself. She tried to hit him again, but rather than taking this one, he caught her fist in one hand. She struggled a moment trying to free it, but his grip was too strong, and he pulled her into a hug.

  || speed=verySlow center=J/sad right=N/embarrassed
    -- It didn't take long for Natalie to cry herself out. She was too self-aware to let loose for long, and she quickly quieted and stilled. She'd hurt him, even if her fist hadn't connected.

    He nodded and made a hurried escape from her room.

    The keel shifted under Natalie's guidance, and the Lapis turned briefly into the wind before settling down on the other tack. She frowned in concentration - if the wind had been blowing any harder against them, she'd have settled for weighing anchor in the harbor and conducting business by boat. But the ship felt good under her hands, the crew confident and cheerful, so an upwind docking into the space between two other ships it was.

    A small crowd gathered to watch them come in, shouting advice, encouragement, or in a few cases, warning them off. Natalie ignored the noise, spun the wheel, shouted to the crew.

    -- `N That's it, strike the sails!` Coasting forward on its momentum, the Lapis dipped between two of the ships already docked and inched forwards towards the pier. The crew tossed lines to the dockworkers, and suddenly everyone was shouting and hauling on ropes and pulling against the wind that wanted to push the Lapis sideways into one of the nearby ships.

    All in all, a rather graceful arrival given the circumstances. Natalie grinned at Kat, at James, at Asara, and hopped onto the pier.

    !! Tomenoi was an odd combination of bustling and dreary. The buildings looked like they could use a fresh coat of paint to hide the dirt, and the streets weren't so much "streets" as they were "beaten paths in the dust." But at the same time, those who greeted her were cheerful and loud, a mix of Vailian sailors and captains slapping her on the back and Kantian merchants and townfolks keeping a more respectful distance.

    She hadn't seen more than a few Kantians in her life before now. Their ships were square rigged, solid but slow, making the journey to Vailia rather arduous for them. The few she had seen were mostly wealthy or powerful - the sort that could afford to take a month or more away from their affairs for a vacation at the center of the known world. The Kantians were generally darker than the Vailians, golden skin and deep brown or black waves of hair.

    ` Welcome to Tomenoi. Docking fee 2 obols per day,` His accent was heavy on the vowels and emphasis, but still easily understandable.

    Expensive. Natalie quirked an eyebrow at the man holding out his hand. `N I'll give you a half.`

    ` One and a half, and I make sure no one else unload same time you do.`

    `N You're kidding me. At Alkenia it's a quarter. Vailia doesn't even have a fee.`

    ` One obol. Those cities don't have to make a living on an otherwise barren island.`

    Natalie dug in her pocket. Better than anchoring in the bay and wasting time trying to move cargo by longboat.

    `N Where?` Natalie looked up at the watchman, unable to make out anything other than shifting darkness.

    `K There, there!` Kat shouted and pointed impatiently.

    Natalie looked where she was pointing again. Nothing, nothing... wait, there was a darker shadow. It soldified slowly as the Lapis came closer. The other ship was drifting, no intention to its motion. She gestured to James, currently taking a turn at the helm, and her nodded. They'd go take a look, rather than let it pass silently.

    -- It was not a pleasant sight. The Kantian ship was missing one mast entirely, and the other square sail was ripped to shreds. Surviving a storm didn't necessarily mean living to tell the tale.

    Scattered around the deck lay men and women. They feebly struggled to their feet, calling out and waving, desperate and hopeful that someone was here to rescue them. As indeed the Lapis was. Once the crew saw the pitiful state of their fellow sailors, no order could have prevented them from bringing the ship in close, tossing over lines and bringing their compatriots aboard. Not that Natalie would have been inclined to deny aid in any case - she was merely busy opening a fresh cask of water.

    -- ` Akylas, captain of the Gallant, and thank the gods for your kindness,` a weather-beaten man introduced himself. He looked torn between wanting to salute her, hug her and run for the water as his crew was doing.

    `N Natalie, of the Lapis Azurai, out from Vailia. What happened?`

    The sad tale was much as she'd guessed. The Gallant had been struck by a storm just over three weeks ago, not only smashing their mast and ripping away the sails, but also flooding the cargo bay and washing away most of their supplies. They'd had plenty of food, but precious little water except when it rained.

    -- Natalie listened sympathetically, and patted Akylas' shoulder for reassurance. `N I think we should be able to rig something up. I can't give away all my spares, but I'm sure we have enough canvas to get you back to port.`

    ` I'm afraid I won't be able to give you anything in return. The storm took everything except our lives. But thank you for that, and for all your kindness.`

    Natalie reassured him that they'd share what they could, and shuddered. Money meant nothing compared to her pleasure that she could help one more crew return safely to port. She was captain of one of the finest ships in the world, and had her magic to protect herself - even so, the open ocean frightened her. Kantians were a brave people indeed.

    Too much James brooding. Too much Asara brooding. Too much Natalie hovering over them and pretending not too. Kat went for a walk. Too much everyone being idiots and not talking to each other the way they should.

    Following a well-worn path alongside the stream, Kat left the trading post and explored up towards its source. She soon found a spring, bubbling out from the side of a mossy boulder into a pleasant little pool. Shaded by trees, the glen was cool and sheltered. A simple wrought iron bench sat near the pool.

    Something about the spring itself caught Kat's attention, and she took a closer look. Bending down, she saw that beneath the moss, the boulder had a smooth, flat surface. She brushed some of the dirt away, pausing to flick cold water over her face. It was a warm day. Definitely not natural.

    Finally, her probing fingers felt something different - faint scratches in the rock, growing deeper and more distinct as she rubbed dirt and much out of them.

    The Lapis arrived late at night, slipping silently into the sheltered bay that Natalie's maps insisted was the center of Nonkenia. It was hard to believe that this empty expanse of sand, much like hundreds of others they'd already sailed past, was something special.

    The signs were there, though; obvious enough to careful eyes as the crew lowered the anchors. There was no dock, but the beach was broken with ridges and piles of sand, as though heavy objects had been dragged over it recently. And the forest was thinner, less overgrown. Natalie would bet good money that trails leading inland would be visible in the morning.

    -- Lowering a boat into the water, Natalie felt as if eyes were twinkling at them from the edge of the forest, a feeling confirmed as soon as they set foot on the beach, when an old man emerged from his hiding place to greet them.

    ` Good evening. May I request an hour of your time before you enter the forest? It is dangerous at night.` Cracked and wizened with age, Natalie found his voice disturbing, threatening even, but pushed down her reaction and forced a smile.

    `N Of course. I'm Natalie, this is James, and...`

    -- ` Stop! Do not share your names so freely. Some might think you tried to ensnare them into reciprocating. Not me, of course. I am used to the ways of foreigners and know you mean no harm.` He gave a dry chuckle, and Natalie bit her tongue to avoid saying anything unfriendly. `What brings you to the shores of Nonkenia?`

  || left=N/uncertain
    `N We come seeking opportunity for trade and mutual profit. I have a cargo hold full of things I think you might be interested in. But I was expecting a city, and all I see is an empty beach?`

    -- He chuckled again, and she couldn't help feeling like she was being mocked. ` Of course you do. I'd be a fool to expect anything else from a Vailian. It's too much to hope that you'd come to visit one of our grand temples, or repent for some devilry or other...` He continued to mutter as he took a jar at his hip and popped off the lid. Dipping a finger in, he reached towards her, something sticky looking - honey perhaps - dripping from his finger. ` Bend down. There's a good girl. I'm not as tall as I used to be.`

    She did as he asked, and he left a sticky dot on her forehead. He swatted away her finger when she reached up to wipe it away.

    -- ` There you go, girl. The forest isn't dangerous anymore. For you. As long as you take the left trail, then left fork, then right. Got that? Left, left, right.` Another dry chuckle, a sound Natalie was beginning to thoroughly loathe. ` Anyone else who feels like walking to the city, come and take your turn. You can wipe it off once you're between buildings, but make sure you get anointed again before you try to return to the ship. It'd be a shame if some of you didn't make it back.`

    `A There are seven of us. Well, perhaps six now. Or five,` she added a little sadly, then shook her head and quickly went on. `A We may pass on our power to a daughter, blood or adapted. Or if one dies without passing on her power, our goddess chooses another. That has happened too often of late.` A sad tone suggested that further inquiries into the matter would not be answered.

    `N Your goddess? Which one?`

    `A Azaraki. We are her chosen people.` Natalie wracked her brain trying to remember anything about the name other than that Asara had used it to refer to her people before. It was odd – the gods and goddesses worshiped didn't vary much throughout all the cultures Vailia had encountered – it was hard to debate exactly who belonged in the pantheon and who didn't when divine influence was quick to correct such matters on a personal level. Only so many false idols could be struck by lightning before people stopped worshiping them. Curious, then, that Natalie had never heard of a goddess potent enough to grant her priestesses such power. There were centainly no temples in Vailia.

    `N Tell me more about her?`

    Asara shook her head. Many of their conversations recently seemed to be going fine, then suddenly, a wall. Natalie didn't understand it, but pressing Asara only resulted in the small woman shying away, withdrawing into herself, or bursting out into tears. She sighed and let the subject drop.

Each of them was armed with a spear, and two little girls walked around passing out javelins.

    Uncertain that she should interfere with a private ceremony, Asara was about to turn back for the ship when a hand tugged at her pants. She he looked down to find a trio of young boys looking up expectantly. ` You have to go into the hut.`

    -- `A What's in the hut?` She found herself oddly relaxed. This felt familiar. The Nonkenian children were more like her own people than the noisy Vailians had been. She examined the stone structure where a war party was gathering.

    ` The hunt-fire. Since you're here, you have to bow to it and say the rite, or they won't catch anything.`

    Asara nodded. It had looked like a war party to her, but a hunting party was better. She had no qualms about helping to bless them. Given the recent troubles between Alkenia and Nonkenia, she wasn't sure if Natalie would have approved of her wishing success to them.

  James jerked and rubbed the side of his head, looking around for the source of the sting. Kat. Sitting on the roof at the edge of the market, she gave him a cheerful wave and hucked another pebbel at his head. This one missed, stinging the back of another shopper. James muttered an appology on her on her behalf and went to see what she wanted.

  -- By the time he reached the edge of the market, she was back on the ground. `J Oww," he greeted her.
  `K I want to show you a thing.`
  `J Weren't you supposed to be running inventory in the cargo hold today?`
  `K Yeah, but I want to show you a thing. Come on.`
  James glanced back longingly at the crowd and the errand he was supposed to be running on Natalie's behalf, and by the time he looked back Kat was disappearing around a corner down the alley. He sighed and followed.

  -- Through back ways and hidden shortcuts she led with an ease of long familiarity that left him panting to keep up, and finally up over a poorly maintained wooden fence. On the other side was a surprise in the middle of the grimy city - a small oasis of verdant green, two trees shading a pleasant square of grass and flowers. Walls rose on all sides, none of them sporting doors - the only way in was hopping the fence as they'd done. Half covered with grass, white stone tiles inlaid the ground in a lose pattern. The mood was pleasant, but Kat's sudden stillness and silence lent the place a solemn air as he took in the scene. He waited for her to speak. Eventually she did.

  -- `K You don't like me, and that's ok. Lots of people don't like me. But I want you to trust me more than you do.`
  `J I don't...` he started to object, but her silence and solemnity, so uncharacteristic, stilled his words. He let the objection die. `J What is this place?`
  She hunted a moment in the grass, then gestured him over and knealt by one of the stones, brushing dirt and grass away to reveal the surface. James crouched next to her.
  ` For Sam, 15 Ascending Air 1217. Kat honors his memory.` chisseled into the stone in small careful letters. Only a few months old. Kat blew the dust away reverently.

  `K One of the priests makes them for us, since none of us can read.`
  James brushed off another stone - another name, a different date, but the same formula. `J Us who?`
  `Kids on the street. The guards always take care of the bodies, so there's nothing to bury.`
  They sat in silence. The early afternoon sun was still hidden by the buildings around them, leaving the little cemetary in shade.

  -- Finally James noddeded and stood.
  Kat remained kneeling for another moment, then popped up to her feet, the movement seeming more nervous than energetic. `K I know I'm a joke. But... I wanted you to see that's not all I am. I hope you can do better than I did, and that maybe you'll let me help.`
  `J I understand.` He put a hand reassuringly on her shoulder, the muscles tense beneath his touch. `J Let's go back to the market. Thank you for showing me this.`

    `N I'm not planning on going myself, but thanks for the tip.

Some contacts in the industry would be an advantage for a rising young captain. Thus Natalie, here, at the edge of the forest, talking with the owner of one of the larger lumber companies. She hadn't been expecting to find him out here, carrying logs and a formidable axe himself, but it was a pleasand surprise. He seemed straightforward and easy to deal with.

    -- ` Hah, a Vailian looking to help, there's a new one. You said you were a captain? Not much use to me, then. We already have an exclusive contract with charter company for forest products. Kind of you to ask, though.` With a grunt he heaved the log back to his shoulder, getting ready to leave. Then he paused, turning back to her, and she had to duck the swing of his beam. ` Well actually, maybe there is something. Bring me a dozen bows with spears and knives to match and I might start thinking you mean it about wanting to help. good Vailian ones, not the dreck we make here. That's what we need - help defending ourselves, not the pretty promises you'd prefer to give.` He laughed at her expression. That much weaponry was, not to put too fine a point on it, rather expensive.

    Maybe she could work something out. `N I can bring you a load at-cost if you'll front 50% of the price.` Natalie winced. It was a huge risk, and if something went wrong, it could almost break her books. Quality arms weren't cheap, and her budget was always tight.

    `J Are you sure we should be doing this, Nat?` James kicked the cask. Compared to the beating it'd take during loading or unloading, a stray kick was nothing. It did waft the scent of the pine oil and honey in Natalie's direction, one sealing the contents against saltwater in case the hold flooded and the other hinting at the contents. Most deals were primarily in goods - far easier for a company to find spare stock than hard cash, and easier for the merchants as well. Only large companies had enough cash to outright purchase enough cargo to fill a ship. `J I don't like being an arms merchant.`

    `N Alkeina's a next door neighbor. It's not like we're selling them to some bloodthirsty warlord. He's just a lumberjack.

    !! An alarm beat in the distance, brass gong barely audible over the crash of waves in the harbor. Asara shielded her eyes, trying to keep the driving rain out of them long enough to see something useful, but to no avail. Alkenia looked quiet as ever, the same buildings huddling together for shelter and same empty streets washing storm water down to the harbor.

    Another alarm, still distant. She and Natalie had heard them a few times in the city, warnings that attackers were in the area. Usually the Alkenians mustered quickly, and a show of force and a few quick arrows were be enough to scare away the small raiding party. A lumber mill would be set fire, a house looted - small damages, mostly meant to reassure the city that the Nonkenians had neither forgotten nor forgiven them.

    It was easy to see how the attackers had penetrated so far into the city today without being confronted. Asara had to keep a hand on the rail to prevent being tossed about by powerful gusts of wind, and she shuddered to imagine trying to direct a military force in brutal conditions like these.

    Time to get moving. They'd have to defend themselves if the Alkenians were too busy hiding from the storm.

    `A That's far enough,` Asara held up an empty hand, the other resting on the sword at her hip. She should have had to shout to make herself heard, but her quiet voice carried over the gusting wind. `A You may not come here.` The sailors behind her held steady, forming a grim line with James at the center.

    The raiders stopped. Half a dozen women, each with the same barbed vine painted across their left cheek and running down their necks, slowly smudging as rain washed them clean, each with the same vicious looking dagger in one hand. They didn't say anything. The silence was more terrifying shouting would have been.

    No one moved. A gust of wind made everyone present stagger.

    Without warning they swept forward again, seeming to move with a single mind. Asara smoothly drew and parried the wicked dagger aimed at her chest. Beside her, one of the crew screamed and fell, tangled with a vine-woman, but Asara had her own problems to attend to. Her attacker ducked slid under her probing counter-stroke and came at her again.

    It was over in an instant, too quickly to think. One of Natalie's crew bled on the ground, and two of the Nonkenias lay dead at Asara's feet. The remainder fled as silently as they'd come, one cluting an injured arm where James had used his own blade. Asara contemplated further violence, but it wasn't necessary. Natalie was still here. She needed to stay with Natalie.

    She wiped her blade on a dead man's shirt, wiped water from her eyes. It had been sloppy, letting them get past her to hurt one of Natalie's crew. Behind her the others tended to the sailor, but caring for the wounded was not her task. Asara kept her ears on the war drums, and her eyes on the streets.

    Ameliss pursed her lips in annoyance, as though having trouble believing that Natalie would actually admit a food fight occurred on her ship. ` That is unfortunate, and I shall have to speak with him about him manners.`

    It sounded like an apology, but couldn't help but feel like the Ameliss was more annoyed at her for refusing to fault the sailor than anything. She tried not to sigh. This was going to be a long voyage.

  Mt. Julia's forested surroundings were an excellent source of timber, untamed and mostly unexploited by human hands - but only a secondary source of lumber for Vailia's growing merchant fleet. With almost no permanent inhabitants, it made only a minimal contribution to the region's industry, despite its seeming abundance.

  -- James pointed out several trees to the crew, marking them for felling and cutting into the planks and boards needed to keep the ship in good repair. Strange that no one lived here - wandering through the pleasant woodland paths, the usual explanation of "too rugged" didn't really hold up. Perhaps something else kept settlers away. James shivered and sought the Lapis out with his eyes. He already had a home, and it suddenly seemed more inviting than this far-too-perfect isle.

  !! Around behind the inn and at a distance from the large storage building sat a small hut, nestled back a hundred yards from the other buildings and half obscured by the forest. A little curl of smoke rose from the stone chimeny. James and one of the crew took a roundabout approach, avoiding the inn and approaching from another direction.

    After ten minutes of picking their way around trees and over logs and scrambling down and back up gulleys, they'd both noticed something wrong. Though the hut remained close enough to see, it somehow never seemed to draw any closer. James nodded, and the sailor nodded in agreement. It was strange, but they weren't ready to give up just yet.

    Slowly, much more slowly than their legs and minds reported, they began to draw nearer. More worrisome than the mere fact that they'd come at least a mile on their way to a distination only a hundred yards distant, were the changes in the forest around them. It was darker now, the trees closer overhead, the bushes more thorny and with fewer friendly leaves.

    Something was very wrong here. ` We should go back, sir. I don't like this.` The crewman hugged himself, looking around nervously.

    `N Nor I. Just a little further, we are making progress.` He gestured to the hut - by now only half as far away. They started walking again.

    The forest grew darker still, silent now, no sound of the distant ocean, which couldn't possibly actually be distant. Shadows began to flank them, something fast and preditory running through the forest in the distance, watching them. James stopped and drew his sword. When they stopped moving, the shadows also paused, watching.

    `J Ok, you're right, this was a bad idea,` James finally admitted. The sailor nodded, but didn't say anything. `J Let's turn back.`

    Thirty paces and they were at the back of the inn, the sun shining brightly overhead again and the shadows gone. The little girl who ran the tavern was out back, splitting wood.

    ` What'cha doing out back here?` She asked, struggling to swing the weight of the sledge over her shoulder. Thunk, it drove the wedge deeper into the log she was splitting. ` Wanna give me a hand? I wish my parents helped with chores sometimes.`

    James shuddered again.

    -- `K Ship ahoy!` Kat called out from her position on the starboard side of the deck, and everyone turned to look. Natalie shaded her eyes, trying to make out anything in the bright sun.

    Drifting slowly closer, it became apparent that the other ship was abandoned, listing to one side as though it had taken on a great deal of water. The Azurai put on sail to approach more rapidly.

    It was more of a half-floating wreck than a real ship at this point, wind-slashed sails and rotting timbers. One of the crew suggested immediately that they fire the thing and be on their way – a funeral fitting an abandoned ship. Hard to say though – there might still be something valuable aboard, and even if not, some of the wood or sailcloth might still be salvageable. Not to mention curiosity for its own sake.

    -- Natalie was about to give the order to lower one of the boats when Asara spoke up. Natalie hadn't seen her arrive on deck - she spent much of her time below, hiding in Natalie's cabin or the cargo hold.

    `A The crew escaped in boats and the cargo is rotten. We should send them on their way.`

    -- `K How can you tell from here?` Kat shaded her eyes against the bright sun, leaning over the railing as though that would give her a better view of the wreck's interior.

    `A They did not all escape the storm. One of them died, and it was a full moon,` Asara nodded, as if expecting that to somehow explain everything. When everyone on deck turned to look at her, she didn't shrink away from the attention as Natalie had assumed she would.

    `A It was at sea, but the full moon is a stronger influence. This falls within my lady's domain.` Her unusual confidence under scrutiny failed, and she hunched her shoulders under the continued gaze of the crew and officers.

    Natalie took pity on her - it was more than the poor girl usually explained herself, and if it was important to her... `N James, fire arrow. Let's set it alight and we'll have a few minutes of silence.` Natalie turned back to smile at Asara, but she was already gone back below decks.

    `A I wish to test my power.`

    Natalie tripped over her own feet, startled. She could have sworn she was alone on deck, everyone else asleep. `S Oh, Asara, make some more noise. You'll frighten me to an early grave.`

    `A Unlikely. You are my friend, and only enemies should fear me.` She said it with such a straight face that Natalie wasn't sure if it was a joke or not. She wasn't sure if Asara even knew how to joke. Natalie settled for an uncertain laugh.

    `N You, um, you aren't going to burn the ship down, are you?`

    -- `A No. That was...` she shuddered, suddenly looking very small and vulnerable. Natalie regretted asking the question, and had to stop herself before she put a hand on Asara's shoulder. `A ...I cannot do such a thing again. My sisters may be so powerful, but I am not. I will be summoning only the blessing, not the flames.`

    It did confirm, unfortunately, that Asara had been responsible for a pillar of silver flame visible from thirty kilometers away, which splintered a ship and made steel run like molasses. Not a comfortable thought. `N What is 'the blessing'?`

    `A The blessing of steel,` she gestured to her silvery eyes. They were truly colorless, sapping even the gold from reflected lantern light. `A I will become strong for a time, nothing more. I merely wished to warn you so you did not think something was amiss.`

    -- `N If all it's going to do is make you strong, how would I know?`

    `A You are a witch, are you not? Your crew calls you one. It is not magic, but you will feel it.` After weeks of near silence and monosyllables, suddenly Asara was being downright talkative. But rather than answering any of Natalie's questions, every time she opened her mouth she raised new ones.

    `N Go ahead. Thank you for the warning.`

    Asara brought out the half-melted chain that she'd been bound with when they first met – Natalie hadn't known she'd kept it. She strained at the broken manacles, tugging at the melted links. Ruined, yes, but still steel. Of course nothing happened.

    -- Then Natalie felt powers gathering, like a storm only visible to the inner mind, making her bones ache and her head pound. Nothing happened. Her head began to swim. Slowly, ever so slowly, the steel links between Asara's hands began to twist and groan, stretching and warping as though being ripped apart by a team of horses rather than in a small girl's bare hands. Natalie grasped her head with both hands. It hurt to think.

    And suddenly it was over. The manacles remained deformed, but the chain hadn't broken. The world no longer pounded nails into Natalie's head. Asara looked at her, then at the metal in her hands, pursing her lips. She threw them. It was a good throw – a plunk reached them a moment later as they landed in the water and sank.

    `A I am not yet ready.` She walked away, leaving Natalie with a million more questions than before the conversation had begun.
