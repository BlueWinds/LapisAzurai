    It was something of a rarity to find two other ships already docked, Mt. Julia being little more than a stopover on the way to more interesting destinations. They'd naturally taken the best spots in the small harbor, forcing the Lapis further out, and leaving Natalie a long walk to the storage yard and inn that were the island's only permanent habitation.

    Though the inn was browded to bursting, she rapidly found herself seated with the other two captains, who shooed one of their crew away to make room for her. The girl who ran the tavern came by a moment later, leaving Natalie with a beer.

    ` I don't suppose you happen to have any canvas to spare? Or tar? I've some of my people distilling some while we attend to other repairs, but but it's slow going.` For the captain, a rough looking older woman, to breach business immediately they must be in desperate straits indeed.

    `N She usually keeps a good supply,` Natalie gestured to the tavern-girl making her way through the crowd of sailors with a tray of drinks. Impressive, the way she seemed to manage the whole place herself, even if service was a bit slow with a crowd this large.

    ` Already cleaned me out of cash on hand, and won't take credit. We barely limped in after a big storm, and I'm just trying to scrounge enough that we can make a break for Vailia and a proper dry-dock.`

    ` We're nigh broke too, until we hit Alkenia and unload out cargo. Same storm caught us, but we were close to shore and rode it out a bit better,` the third captain volunteered.

    Natalie nodded sympathetically and considered her own stores. James would have an exact accounting in his head, but he wasn't here to answer questions. `N You're Guild, right? I don't think we can spare enough to make a difference, but we do have cash, and I'd be happy to float you a loan until you reach Vailia.`
