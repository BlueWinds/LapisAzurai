    Things were going well in the new city, merchants clamoring for Vailian goods, willing to pay virtually any price to import legendary mechanical devices and high quality steel goods from the "exotic far west."

    Natalie returned to the ship early in the afternoon, ledgers filled with potential clients, to find James sitting quietly on the deck. He was bent over his work, using a pair of pliers to straighten wire with intense concentration. He hadn't noticed her yet. Natalie grinned.

    She put a finger to her lips as she came up the ramp onto deck, quiting the crewman on watch before he said anything. The sailor watched with amused interest as she snuck up behind James. Not difficult, since he was both busy and not expecting her to be back so soon.

    She leaned over, holding her breath so as not to alert him, opened her mouth wide, aaaaaand... chomp, she bit down on the back of his neck. He shouted and flailed, knocking her back on her ass laughing as he came to his feet and whirled on her.

    `J Natalie! What the hell was that?` His face was red, his tools scattered across the deck, and Natalie couldn't catch her breath to answer for laughing. `J The hell?`

    Just like old times.
