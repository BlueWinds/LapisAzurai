    `K What's on your mind, cap'n?` Kat lay sprawled across Natalie's lap, belly down, feat beeting an idle rythem against the wall of the cabin. Natalie sat on her bed, in theory reviewing the Lapis' accounts, but in reality staring at the page without seeing it.

    `N Sorry, distracted.`

    `K You've been distracted ever since meeting with the fancy Kantian lord.` Kat rolled overonto her back. She wasn't wearing anything except pants, and the sight was rather distracting itself. `K So what'cha thinking about?`

    `N Fame and fortune, the acquisition thereof.` She set the ledger aside, wiggled Kat's head into a more comportable position on her lap.

    `K Daydreaming's my thing. You're supposed to be the level headed and practical one.`

    `N Not daydreaming. Elakim offerefed my partial ownership of the UTC.`

    `K Huh. You-tea-sea?`

    `N The company that owns the amulets. Major trading consortium in Kantis. It's where the mage-lords' wealth comes from.`

    Kat whistled. `K Big stuff. So why you?`

    `N Magic. I help power the amulets, they give me a share of the profits.`

    Kat was silent for a moment, and Natalie filled the silence by stroking Kat's cheek. She nuzzled the hand and spoke. `K I don't like those.`

    `N Why not?`

    `K One hurt you just by being in the same room.`

    `N I think that was me, not the amulet.`

    `K Then you might hurt yourself again.`

    `N I think I know how to avoid that.`

    `K Seems like a raw deal for anyone who isn't a mage.`

    `N I think it's not that much worse than the Guild, and we're pretty fair, all things considered.`

    `K That's three 'I think's in a row.`

    `N I did say I was still thinking about it.`

    `K Well, stop brooding and start looking for answers. Running off half-baked is my thing, and brooding is Asara's. So go get your answers before you say yes and let me and Asara get on with your business.`

    `N I thought you didn't like the amulets?`

    Kat rolled to her side and pulled her knees up, curling around Natalie's midriff. `K I don't, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't get all rich and stuff.` She squeezed Natalie's torso in a hug. `K I mean, you're not gonna leave behind your loyal crew, right cap'n?`

    `N Mercenary.` Natalie laughed. `N I'm not leaving you anywhere.`

    Antinua and Hathawa shared James' cabin, relegating him to general quarters with the rest of the crew. He didn't mind much, enjoying the warmth that close company brought. He'd grown up sleeping in the attic above a smithy, in a neighborhood full of the same. Heat and noise were comfort. It was always cold at sea.

    Hathawa kept to herself, friendly but reserved if approached alone. When Antinue was around she grew more animated, more confident dealing with strangers. The mercenary herself was all friendly banter and easy coradery, instantly popular with the sailors. James wondered if any of them felt the falsity of her mask the way he did.

    ` Tell me of Kantis.` Antinua sought him out one evening - holding watch over an empty ocean, he had little excuse not to speak with her.

    `J It's a city, the largest I've seen besides Vailia. More than its fair share of wealth. More than its fairshare of poverty. Little in between. What yould you like to know?`

    ` An outsider's perspective. Asara sees nothing but evil there. It's hard to see past one's experiences. Natalie sees nothing but good. It's her nature.` She held up a hand to forestall his forming objection. ` So I come to you for your thoughts. It's no slight on your captain to speak of her as she is.`

    He sighed and rubbed his hands together against the cold. `J I suppose so. Nat always does see the world through a rosy glow.`

    ` Tell me more about the city.`
