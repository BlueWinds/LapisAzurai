    A gaggle of troops blocked the dock, debarking ships and assembling into companies. Kat found herself a perch on a crate and enjoyed the view (cute boys in uniforms) - at least until she noticed that Asara wasn't with her anymore, rather than waiting patiently. She hopped off and turned went to find her companion.

    Not hard on a small ship - Asara was hiding in the cargo hold, pale, gripping the pommel of her sword. She nodded at Kat, but didn't relax. `A Are they gone?`

    `K Nope, still getting ready. A lot of them. You know what they're doing out here?`

    `A Fighting with my people.`

    `K Huh. Over what?`

    Asara shrugged. `A Does it matter?`

    `K Of course it does.`

    She frowned and didn't answer.

    `N I'm sorry, James.` Natalie put a hand on his shoulder, turningh him to face her. He'd been packing. `N I need you to watch the ship, not come with me this time.`

    He slimped against the wall, partly filled pack hanging from one hand, eyes closed a moment, resting. `J I suppose I should have expected this.`

    `N It's not because I don't want you there,` she hurridly continued on, `N I really do, it's just that there's no one else I can trust to keep watch over the Lapis here in Kantian waters, and Kat won't be coming either, and...`

    James cut off her babbling explanation with a shake of his head. `J No, no, they're all good reasons, I'm not accusing. I <i>should</i> have expected it. Doesn't mean it's not hard.` He put his pack down, stood up straight.

    She put a hand on his shoulder again, hesitated, moved it to his cheek. Gently she drew his head down to her level and kissed his forehead. `N I <i>will</i> be back, James. You're my partner, and I won't leave you behind, not now, not ever.`
