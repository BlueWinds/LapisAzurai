    A gaggle of troops blocked the dock, debarking ships and assembling into companies. Kat found herself a perch on a crate and enjoyed the view (cute boys in uniforms) - at least until she noticed that Asara wasn't with her anymore, rather than waiting patiently. She hopped off and turned went to find her companion.

    Not hard on a small ship - Asara was hiding in the cargo hold, pale, gripping the pommel of her sword. She nodded at Kat, but didn't relax. `A Are they gone?`

    `K Nope, still getting ready. A lot of them. You know what they're doing out here?`

    `A Fighting with my people.`

    `K Huh. Over what?`

    Asara shrugged. `A Does it matter?`

    `K Of course it does.`

    She frowned and didn't answer.
